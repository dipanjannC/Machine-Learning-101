The P2 64 and P3 regions encode the non-structural proteins 2B and 2C and 3A, 3B (1-3) (VPg), 3C pro and 4 structural protein-coding region is replaced by reporter genes, allow the study of genome 68 replication without the requirement for high containment (9, 10) ( figure 1A ).The FMDV 5â² UTR is the largest known picornavirus UTR, comprising approximately 1300 71 nucleotides and containing several highly structured regions. The first 360 nucleotides at the 5â² 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) . The presence of PKs has been reported in the 5â² UTR of other picornaviruses such as 92 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).To introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ÎPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3â² end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ÎPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.132 133 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This was performed by PCR mutagenesis using primers C0 SpeI, and FMDV 1331- In vitro transcription. 143 In vitro transcription reactions for replicon assays were performed as described previously (28).Transcription reactions to produce large amounts of RNA for SHAPE analysis were performed 145 with purified linear DNA as described above, and 1 Î¼g of linearised DNA was then used in a 146 HiScribe T7 synthesis kit (NEB), before DNase treatment and purification using a PureLink FastQ files were quality checked using FastQC with poor quality reads filtered using the 225 Sickle algorithm.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.Changing the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5â² UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.Moreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques. In addition, these differences were more pronounced in more PKs is functionally competent as no differences was seen between replicons congaing a single 472 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).The presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.Healthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.This study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.Recent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.The Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .The ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.The reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \n","Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and the high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced diagnostics. 15 Clinical swab samples (n = 15) were obtained from samples submitted to the Poultry Diagnostic & Research Center, University of Georgia. Detailed information about the samples is provided in Table 1 .Total RNA was extracted from each of the swab samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions, aliquoted, and stored at â80 ÂºC until further use. These samples were previously tested for IBV and GA08 serotype of IBV.Briefly, a pan IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 was used to detect IBV in general and then IBV strain specific RT-qPCR assay 36 was used to detect GA08 in the samples using the AgPath ID, One step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST following the previously described protocols.For MinION cDNA synthesis, RNA was extracted from 500 Âµl of each clinical sample using Trizol-LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer's directions.A reaction mixture of 8 Âµl of total RNA, 1 Âµl of random primers and 1 Âµl of dNTPs was incubated at 65 Â°C for 5 min, chilled on ice for at least 1 min followed by addition of 10 Âµl of cDNA synthesis mix including SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. The reaction was incubated at 25 Â°C for 10 min, then at 50 Â°C for 50 min for cDNA synthesis. The reaction was terminated at 85 Â°C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. To remove residual RNA, the cDNA solution was incubated with RNase H at 37 Â°C for 20 min. All rights reserved.

Sequencing was allowed to continue for 2 hours until 42,940 reads were obtained for Run1 and 156,000 reads were obtained for Run 2 in 6 hours.First, a lineage-typing database, containing 32 IBV S1 gene sequences (one sequence from each of 32 lineages in the 6 genotypes 44 ) and the chicken genome (GCF_000002315.4_Gallus_gallus-5.0), was constructed (referred to as \"IBV-lineage-typing database\" in this study). A second database was constructed with all the Avian Coronaviruses S1 sequences (n = 7328) available in NCBI (as of: 09-08-2017) and the chicken genome (referred to as \"All-IBV database\" in this study). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint used to assign IBV lineages to each read, as appropriate. The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.The IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score.Since some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.A schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases.Briefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input.

No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint First, the basecalled reads were aligned to the IBV-lineage-typing database using BLASTn and reads were clustered based on the read sequence alignment to the respective prototype sequence of IBV lineage. These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster.A minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \"top hit\" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \"sequence identity\" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \"minimum mismatches\" and \"coverage\" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as \"top hit\" in the final results.For Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) . Firstly, a primer set based on Connecticut sequence NCBI FJ904716.1 was used to amplify Genotype I-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Connecticut All rights reserved.

Secondly, a primer set based on GA98 sequence NCBI AF274439.1 was used to amplify Genotype IV-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Georgia 1998 and Delaware 072 serotypes). Primer sets were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. 51 The PCR reaction mixture is composed of 10 Âµl of cDNA, 0.5 Âµl of 10 ÂµM forward primer, 0.5 Âµl of 10 ÂµM reverse primer, 2.5 Âµl of 10Ã buffer, 0.5 Âµl of enzyme mix, and 0.5 Âµl of 10mM dNTPs, then made the final volume to 25 Âµl with nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 Â°C for 1 min, followed by For Sanger sequencing data, the chromatogram from each of the samples was manually checked and primer sequences were trimmed in MEGA 6.0. 42 Forward and reverse sequences from multiple clones were aligned using MEGA 6.0 software and consensus sequences were All rights reserved.

Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) .A total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ). By using the GI-L1 primer set, which amplified Conn and Mass type IBVs, 3 of 9 IBV-positive samples were All rights reserved.

Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) .PCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940).After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters.The Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples.The number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) .Sequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample.Finally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ).

A total of 146,540 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 156,000). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 4,285 to 41,131. A total of 24,297 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 8,109 reads were discarded due to middle adapters in the basecalled reads.Real-time analysis of MinION data, which was obtained within 10 minutes of the sequencing, was sufficient for detection of IBV. However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay. All 5 samples were positive for IBV MDL_DMV1639 variant of IBV (Table 5) .In all of the samples where a matching IBV genotype/lineage was identified by both AmpSeq and Sanger sequencing, the AmpSeq data showed high concordance with Sanger sequencing data, In one sample (#4), only a single MinION read of GA98 was detected by All rights reserved.

Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.The proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and Â½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.One area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.For example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.The advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.

It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] .Wuhan is central China's transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] .The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY's Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions.To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China.To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY's day, and given that LNY's day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city's lockdown.These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks..

IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China.We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city's travel ban. The LNY's day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY's day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] .Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes..

Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses.Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY's Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day.We found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan's .

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan's lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ).In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY's Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ).According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ).Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ).Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered.Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.Mobile phone-based population movement data and air passenger .

Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] .In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak's initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] .Moreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY's day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers.Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] . In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority.It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread.Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months.Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel volumes, our primary analyses assume \"business as usual\" travel based on .

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic..

The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death.Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed \"cytokine storms\" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease.Here, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS.Coronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs).To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above.For the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ).Although TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems.TWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide \"Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher\" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is \"Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination\". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 .The relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of \"Spike protein (S) of coronavirus\", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field.The distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category.We coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97).Those CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference.Several hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs. These IFITMs were significantly enriched in the local samples representing updated coronavirus-related All rights reserved.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response.Combining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\"In addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories.In this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease.For example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports.We next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections.In this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions.virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes.Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system.Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-Î³-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus.We expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data. Although histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, the right lung showed evidence of desquamation of All rights reserved.

The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps.The dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword \"coronavirus\". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword \"public health\" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses.Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG).Similar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text. Here, we used a Z score cutoff value > 6.In addition, some entities have singular and plural noun forms, and synonyms with multiple forms in the abstracts. Therefore, we numbered the subject-related entity and automatically combined nouns with plural forms and homologous words with adjectives and adverb roots into the same entity, and then assigned them the same number.

We exclude Table S2 and Methods). VIPs in our dataset interact with viral 16 proteins, viral RNA, or viral DNA. Most of them (95%) correspond to an interaction 17 between a human protein and a virus infecting humans (Table S1 ). HumanImmunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the best-represented virus with 240 VIPs, with 19 nine other viruses having at least 50 VIPs (Table S1 ).Because we want to understand how adaptation to viruses proceeded, we then select 19 proteins with i) at least one available tertiary structure, ii) amino acid level resolution of 20 the interaction with one or more viruses, and iii) host tropism.This dataset represents the largest, most up-to-date set of VIPs backed up by individual 21 low-throughput publications. Nonetheless, given that many VIPs were discovered only (Methods and Table S4 ). These 241 immune VIPs include the VIPs 2 classified as antiviral (Table S4 ) throughout this manuscript. In total, 162 overlapping GO 3 cellular and supracellular processes have more than 50 VIPs (Table S3) . These 4 observations confirm that viruses interact with proteins involved in the majority of basic 5 cellular processes. To disentangle whether the slower evolution of VIPs is due to stronger purifying 14 selection or to a lower rate of adaptation, we use the ratio of non-synonymous 15 polymorphisms to synonymous polymorphisms pN/pS rather than the dN/dS ratio. Unlike 16 dN/dS that is strongly influenced by both the effects of purifying selection and 17 adaptation, pN/pS is primarily determined by the efficiency of purifying selection in 18 removing deleterious non-synonymous mutations..

Specifically, 1 we measure pN/pS as the average across non-human great apes (or as the average in 2 the 1,000 Genomes African populations; Supplemental Methods) using the data from the 3 largest chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan populations in order to further limit the noise In line with this, VIPs also show an excess of low frequency (â¤10%) deleterious non-12 synonymous variants compared to non-VIPs ( Figure S3 ). In great apes, the average The product of P-values is a good measure of whether a specific protein experienced We created a permutation test that compares VIPs and non-VIPs with the same amount 12 of purifying selection. This is achieved by using the pN/pS ratio as a proxy for purifying 14 Retrieving of ANPEP mammalian coding sequences 15 We analyzed patterns of adaptation in ANPEP in a tree of mammals including 84 16 species. These species are the ones with annotated, known or predicted mRNAs ( Table   17 S11 for their Genbank identifiers). The coding sequences were extracted from the 18 mRNAs and aligned with PRANK.The higher level of purifying selection in VIPs might be due to the fact that VIPs 22 participate in the more constrained host functions, or, alternatively, because within each 23 specific host function, viruses tend to interact with the more constrained proteins. In 24 order to assess these two non-mutually exclusive scenarios we generated 10 4 control 25 sets of non-VIPs chosen to be in the same 162 Gene Ontology processes as VIPs (GO 26 processes with more than 50 VIPs; Table S3 and Methods).The high Î± in VIPs is not explained by higher rates of adaptation in the host GO 22 processes where VIPs are well represented ( Figure S4 and Methods). Furthermore, the 23 large difference in Î± observed between VIPs and non-VIPs is robust to a number of 24 potentially confounding factors such as recombination, GC content or gene length (Table   25 S9 and Supplemental Methods). The lower pN/pS in VIPs does not explain their higher Î± 26 either (Table S9 ).The most positively selected non-antiviral VIP that fulfills all these requirements is Figure 4D ). The consensus was regained only two times after loss 28 ( Figure 4D ). This means that the signals of adaptation detected at the first and third In great apes, GO-matched non-VIPs still have a much higher pN/pS ratio compared to 28 VIPs, suggesting that VIPs tend to be more conserved than non-VIPs from the same GO The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 permutation test P=0 after 10 9 iterations). The stronger purifying selection acting on VIPs 1 is apparent within most functions. Figure 1C shows stronger purifying selection in the 20 2 high level GO categories with the most VIPs. In all the 20 GO categories pN/pS is lower 3 in VIPs than in non-VIPs, and the difference is significant for 17 of these categories 4 (Table S3 ). This shows that within a wide range of host functions, viruses tend to target 5 the most conserved proteins.We further use the classic MK test (excluding variants below 10%) to investigate the 28 excess of adaptation for the specific VIPs of ten human viruses and in the 20 high level 29 GO categories with the most VIPs ( Figure 1E and F). We do not use the asymptotic MK Pleiotropy is more likely in proteins with many functions (He and Zhang, 2006), and the 28 subset of VIPs with many annotated GO processes has an excess of adaptation that is 29 very similar to the one observed when using all VIPs ( Figure S8B ). Adaptation to viruses 30 could thus have affected the evolution of host phenotypes in unexpected ways. In this 31 respect, it is particularly intriguing that VIPs have experienced highly increased rates of 32 adaptation within host functions such as development or neurogenesis (Table S3) .Interestingly, even immune VIPs (Table S4 ) have a significantly reduced pN/pS ratio 7 compared to immune non-VIPs ( Figure 1C ), which suggests that immune proteins in 8 direct contact with viruses are more constrained. The reduction in pN/pS in non-immune 9 VIPs (no antiviral or any other immune function, Table S4 ) is very similar to the reduction 10 observed in the entire set of VIPs ( Figure 1C ). Table S3 Table S5 ). Since VIPs are more 23 constrained than non-VIPs and tend to have more non-synonymous deleterious low 24 frequency variants than non-VIPs (Figures 1 and S3 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7The classic MK test is known to be biased downward by the presence of slightly 1 deleterious non-synonymous variants and this bias is difficult to eliminate fully even by 2 excluding low frequency variants (Messer and Petrov, 2013) . Note that our application 3 of the classic MK test to discover the higher rate of adaptation in VIPs compared to non-4 VIPs is conservative given that the VIPs have a higher proportion of slightly deleterious We therefore apply an asymptotic modification of the MK test known to provide 10 estimates of Î± without a downward bias in the presence of slightly deleterious variants 11 (Messer and Petrov, 2013) . To further validate the asymptotic MK test we carry out 12 extensive population simulations (Messer, 2013) to show that this test is indeed robust to 13 a number of potential biases (Supplemental Methods and Table S8 ).14 Using the asymptotic MK test we estimate that in VIPs, ~27% of the 1,897 amino acid 15 substitutions along the human lineage were adaptive ( Figure 1D ). This proportion is 16 three times higher than the estimated proportion of ~9% in non-VIPs ( Figure 1D ). Thus,although VIPs represent only 13% of the orthologs in our dataset, we estimate that in 18 human evolution they account for almost 30% of all adaptive amino-acid changes. Note Although we already find a strong signal of increased adaptation, the amount of adaptive 18 evolution that can be attributed to viruses is probably underestimated by our analysis.Finally and importantly, the 80% of VIPs with no known antiviral or broader immune 6 function (Table S4 ) have a strongly increased rate of adaptation according to both the 7 classic MK test (Î±=0.26 in VIPs versus -0.02 in non-VIPs, permutation test P=3x10 -7 ; 8 Figure 1F ) and the asymptotic MK test, with the latter estimating Î±=38% in non-immune 9 VIPs against only 11% for non-immune non-VIPs. Intriguingly, unlike for non-immune 10 VIPs or all VIPs considered together (top of Figure 1F ), immune VIPs, including antiviral 11 VIPs (Table S4) , do not show any increase of adaptation compared to immune non-VIPs. We speculate that this pattern might reflect the masking effect of balancing The increased rate of adaptation in VIPs in the human lineage strongly suggests that 20 VIPs in our dataset, 95% of which interact with modern viruses (Table S1 ), were also 21 VIPs during past human evolution. It is also plausible that a substantial proportion of the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 1 mammalian tree used for the analysis (Methods). For a specific coding sequence, the 2 BS-REL test estimates the proportion of codons where the rate of non-synonymous 3 substitutions is higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS>1), which is a 4 hallmark of adaptive evolution. The BS-REL test then compares two competing models 5 of evolution, one with adaptive substitutions and one without adaptive substitutions, and 6 decides which of the two models is the best fit. For each branch of the tree, the BS-REL 7 test provides a P-value that corresponds to the probability that no adaptation occurred in 8 the branch. The product of P-values across all branches in the tree then gives the 9 probability that no adaptation occurred anywhere along the entire tree (Supplemental 10 Methods).The purifying selection-wise permutation test shows that adaptation has been much 29 more common in VIPs than in non-VIPs across mammals (Figure 2 ). We estimate thatVIPs have experienced 77% more adaptation compared to non-VIPs (Figure 2A) . In 31 total, this represents ~76,000 more adaptive amino acid changes in VIPs compared to 32 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint non-VIPs. We further use an increasingly strict level of evidence for the presence of 1 adaptation, by including only proteins with increasingly low products of P-values; that is, 2 increasingly low probability that no adaptation occurred (Figure 2A ). Figure GO processes with a strong excess of adaptation include cellular processes such as 17 transcription, signal transduction, apoptosis, or post-translational protein modification, 18 but also supracellular processes related to development ( Figure 2C and Table S3 ).Since 95% of the VIPs were discovered for viruses infecting humans, it is possible that 24 the observed excess of adaptation in VIPs in mammals is due to higher rates of 25 adaptation exclusively in the primate branches of the mammalian tree ( Figure S1 ).However, all mammalian clades in the tree show a similar excess of adaptation in VIPs 27 ( Figure 2D ). Primates stand out due to their low overall proportions of positively selected 28 codons compared to the other mammalian clades in the tree ( Figure 2D ).

Annotation Interestingly, VIPs tend to be multifunctional proteins. Indeed they represent 13% of all 25 the orthologs in the analysis, 33% of the orthologs with 60 or more annotated GO 26 processes, and 40% of orthologs with 100 or more GO processes ( Figure S8A )..

All: entire tree. Primata:\n","they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.Children represent an epidemiological group of central importance for the transmission of influenza [76, 95, 5] . They often have a larger vulnerability to infections because of limited prior immunity, and they mix at school with high contact rates [80] thus representing key drivers for influenza spread. The closure of school has been associated to the potential of reducing influenza propagation in the community by breaking important chains of transmission. It is expected to potentially delay the peak, and reduce the epidemic impact, at peak time and of the overall wave. Though not specifically recommended by the World Health Organization during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is envisioned as a possible non-pharmaceutical intervention for pandemic mitigation left to the decision of national and local authorities [12, 98] .A large body of literature exists on the topic, however contrasting evidence lead to no definitive emerging consensus [22, 69] . Benefits and limita-tions appear to depend on the specific epidemic context. For example, influenza epidemics characterized by a larger attack rate in children compared to adults are expected to be more sensitive to the closure of schools [24] . This experience was reported in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where closed schools coincided with a marked reduction of influenza activity [71, 82, 25, 64, 99, 28, 29, 79, 42, 43, 4, 33, 65] . School closure interventions are often considered along with other mitigation strategies, as it happened with social distancing in Mexico following the pandemic outbreak [35, 28] , making their effect more difficult to isolate. Studies generally report a slowing down effect in the incidence during closure, however in some cases the effect may be mixed with the natural decline of the epidemic, because of late implementation [69] . In addition, no clear trend is observed in the impact of school closure on the epidemic burden depending on the time of closure -before, around, or after the peak [69] .Given its potentially important role in reducing the epidemic impact, school closure has more often been investigated in the realm of pandemics compared to seasonal influenza [69] . For the latter, regular school closure during holidays in temperate regions has been considered as a natural example to evaluate the impact of school closure [62, 23, 52] . Directly extending the application to pandemic situations has however important limitations. Closure associated to winter holidays is regularly scheduled in the school calendar, whereas school closure as an intervention corresponds to an unplanned interruption of school attendance that may take different forms (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, at the national or local level, with a gradual closure of classes or of the entire school) [22, 53, 49, 30] . In addition to the different nature of closure, also its duration changes from a fixed scheduled period of holidays to one of variable extension depending on the ongoing epidemic and resulting outcome. How individual behavior changes in all these conditions is the critical aspect to quantify in order to accurately assess the impact of school closure on transmission.Transmission models fitting the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or parameterized to a similar pandemic scenario have been used to assess the value of school closure or summer holidays [79, 39, 4, 49, 30] . Few of them are based on estimates for social mixing changes [39, 4] , as data collected during a pandemic are limited [68, 39] , leaving other approaches to rely on assumptions about contacts that may critically affect the studies' findings. Applications to seasonal influenza may on the other hand count on a more accurate description of population mixing. Surveys conducted over the calendar year to measure variations of mixing patterns [61, 41, 40, 13] offer indeed the opportunity to perform data-driven modeling studies that mechanistically assess the role of school holidays on seasonal influenza. Interestingly, they also highlighted considerably large differences across countries in the way contacts change from term-time to school holidays [61] , suggesting the need for country-specific estimates to accurately and reliably parameterize models.Changes in mobility is another important aspect that is rarely integrated in school closure studies. Travel is known to be responsible for the spatial dissemination of influenza [57, 94, 32, 46, 44, 47, 9, 10, 7, 4] . In addition to extraordinary travel drops in reaction to epidemics [2, 7, 84] , mobility changes regularly occur during school holidays compared to term-time [75, 45] . Moreover, important differences were highlighted in the mobility of children vs. adults and their associated variations, so that their coupling with social mixing changes occurring during holidays may have a considerable impact on the epidemic outcome [4, 45] .Our aim is to explicitly integrate social mixing and travel from data into a modeling framework to assess how variations induced by regular school closure may impact seasonal influenza epidemics. Three modeling studies were developed so far with similar objectives. Towers and Chowell studied the impact of day-of-week variations in human social contact patterns on incidence data collected at a large hospital in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 H1N1pdm [90] . Their approach was not spatial, therefore did not consider mobility changes, and mainly focused on the sensitivity of influenza incidence variations to the latency period. Apolloni et al. used a stylized analytical approach to evaluate the role of age-dependent social mixing and travel behavior on the conditions for epidemic spatial invasion [4] . The model can compare different contexts, with or without schools in terms, and also account for associated changes. The contexts are however considered independently (no full school calendar can be considered) and the epidemic impact is evaluated only in terms of conditions for spatial dissemination. Going beyond these limitations, more recently Ewing et al. introduced an age-specific spatial metapopulation model to evaluate how behavioral changes associated to winter holiday impact the flu season [45] . The model is applied to the United States and it integrates data on travel behavior, whereas mixing is assumed from estimates available from Europe and adapted to summer holiday changes measured in the UK during the 2009 pandemic [39] . Their findings identify changes in mixing patterns as the key element responsible for the epidemic effects induced by holidays.Given the central role of mixing patterns largely supported by evidence [22, 69, 4, 45] , the heterogeneous country-specific contact variations measured in Europe [80, 61] , and the marked difference expected in individual behavior during a seasonal flu epidemic vs. a pandemic, here we extend prior approaches to introduce a data-driven spatially explicit model fully parameterized on Belgium. The aim is to reduce assumptions in favor of input data, and to exclusively focus on seasonal influenza and associated parameterization. Contact data associated to four types of calendar days are considered, belonging to Regular Weekday, Regular Weekend, Holiday Weekday, Holiday Weekend (here 'regular' refers to non-holiday period), allowing us to assess the role of weekends in addition to holidays. A richer calendar with additional holidays beyond Christmas break is also considered. Confirming and extending prior results with a different modeling approach and input data would greatly support our understanding of the role of changes in mixing and travel on influenza epidemics.In order to study the role of changes in contact patterns and in travel behavior along the calendar, we considered a mathematical approach for the spatial transmission of influenza in Belgium. We built a discrete stochastic age-specific spatial metapopulation model at the municipality level, based on demographic, mixing, and mobility data of Belgium. We parameterized it with influenza-like-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health at the district level for the 2008/2009 season. By using the Belgian school calendar for that season, we assessed the impact of the individual changes in mixing and travel behavior during regular school closure, given by available data. We then tested experimental scenarios to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed epidemic outcomes. Here, we describe in detail the mathematical model, input data, calibration procedure and experimental scenarios.nected through a coupling process generally describing hosts mobility. Here we consider the population to be divided into two age classes, children and adults, based on the modeling framework introduced by Apolloni et al. [4] . Infection dynamics occur inside each patch, driven by the contacts between and within these two classes, and spatial spread occurs via the mobility of individuals ( Figure 1 ). Both processes are modeled explicitly with a discrete and stochastic approach. The model is based on Belgian data and follows the time evolution of the 2008/2009 school calendar. It includes 589 patches corresponding to the 589 municipalities (nl. gemeenten, fr. communes) of Belgium. Weekends and school holidays are explicitly considered, and variations in mixing and travel behavior are accounted for in the model and based on data. In the following, we describe in detail the various components of the model.Individuals are divided into children (c, age less than 19y) and adults (a, otherwise). Population size and age structure per municipality as of January 1, 2008 are obtained from Belgian Statistics [1] .Social mixing between the two age groups is quantified by contact matrices extracted from the data obtained through a Belgian social contact survey [80, 61] :where the element ij (i = a, c, j = a, c) is given by:with M ij the average number of contacts made by survey participants in age class i with individuals in age class j, N j the population of age class j, N tot the total population of Belgium. C C C is defined at the national level, and here we assume that it is the same throughout the country, with the number of contacts being altered exclusively by the patch demography. From survey data, we have that the contact matrix for a regular weekday is:C reg weekday C reg weekday C reg weekday = C cc C ca C ac C aa = 40.71 7.84 7.84 14.25 .(The variations for the other day types are discussed in paragraph 2.1.4.All rights reserved.

Figure 1 : Schematic illustration of the spatial age-structured metapopulation model. The metapopulation modeling scheme is composed of three layers. At the country scale, Belgium is modeled as a set of patches (here indicated with q and p) corresponding to municipalities coupled through mobility of individuals f pq (i) of age class i at time t. Within each municipality, population is divided into two age classes, children (c) and adults (a), whose mixing pattern is defined by the contact matrix C C C. Individuals resident of patch p and individuals commuting to that patch (e.g. resident of patch q) mix together following commuting. The figure reports as an example the contact matrix of a regular weekday (Eq. (3)). Mobility and mixing vary based on the calendar day (regular/holiday, weekday/weekend). Influenza disease progression at the individual level is modeled through a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered compartmental scheme, with Î² indicating the per-contact transmission rate, the rate from exposed to infectious state, Âµ the recovery rate.Influenza disease progression is described through a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model ( Figure 1 ) [3, 74] . A susceptible individual can contract the disease with a per-contact transmissibility rate Î² from infectious individuals, then entering the exposed or latent class. After an average latency period of â1 = 1.1 days [15, 20] , the individual becomes infectious for an average duration Âµ â1 = 3 days [15, 20] and can transmit the infection, before recovering and becoming immune to the disease. A fraction of children (g c ) and adults (g a ) were considered immune to the disease at the beginning of the influenza epidemic, based on available knowledge on prior immunity and vaccination coverage in the country for the 2008/2009 influenza season and prior seasons (g c = 39.87%, g a = 53.19%) [100, 72, 89] .The force of infection for a susceptible individual of age class i (i = a, c) in a given patch p is given by:where j runs on age classes, I p j (t) and N p (t) count the total number of infectious individuals of age class j and the total population size of patch p at time t, respectively. This quantity changes with time for two reasons. The first is the school calendar, distinguishing between regular weekdays, regular weekends, holiday weekdays, holidays weekends, and accounted for by C ij (t). The second is the mobility of individuals. At a given day of the simulation, each patch p may include: non-commuting residents of p, commuters from neighboring patches for school/work, commuting residents of p after school/work (see paragraph 2.1.3).Coupling from patch p to patch q is given by the mobility of age class i, i.e. f pq (i) (Figure 1 ). We considered commuting data across patches from the 2001 Socio Economic Survey of the Belgian Census [66] to describe the regular mobility of individuals for school/work during a regular weekday. Data are not age-specific, so we extracted the commuting fluxes per age class based on the probability of children (adults) of commuting on a given distance computed on the French commuting data [67] . Such inference was based on the assumption of a similar mobility behavior across the two neighboring countries.Air travel was not considered due to negligible internal air traffic within the country.Changes in social mixing are based on the data of the Belgian social contact survey [80, 61] , where participants were asked to report their number of contacts during a regular weekday, a regular weekend, a holiday weekday or a holiday weekend. In addition to the contact matrix of Eq.(3), we have:C reg weekend C reg weekend C reg weekend = 12.51 6.00 6.00 10.85 for a regular weekend,C hol weekday C hol weekday C hol weekday = 14.02 7.28 7.28 12.29 for a holiday weekday,C hol weekdend C hol weekdend C hol weekdend = 10.89 7.20 7.20 8.59 for a holiday weekend.Concerning variations in mobility, schools are closed during weekends and holidays, so no commuting exists for children in those days. We considered adults to continue commuting during holiday weekdays, assuming that adults' time off of work would be homogeneously distributed throughout the year. Concerning adult mobility during the weekends, we estimated the travel fluxes reductions based on statistics available for France [88], based on the same assumptions explained in paragraph 2.1.3. The resulting agespecific reductions for mobility are defined in Table 1 . Time is discretized considering a time step of dt = 0.5 days, with one timestep corresponding to the activities performed during a workday (i.e. commuting, social mixing), followed by a time step corresponding to the activities performed out of that timeframe (i.e. social mixing), as typically done in agent-based epidemic models [79] . Influenza transmission within each patch is modeled with binomial processes. Starting from the initial conditions set by influenza-like-illness surveillance data, we performed 2Â·10 3 stochastic runs for each model under study.Our model was based on the official Belgian school calendar for school year 2008/2009. Classes in Belgium are in session from Monday to Friday, and schools are closed during the weekends. The calendar included the following holidays for the 2008/2009 academic year during which schools were closed:â¢ Fall holiday: from October 25 to November 2, including the public holiday of the first and second of November;â¢ Public holiday of November 11;â¢ Christmas holiday: from December 20, 2008 to January 4, 2009;â¢ Winter holiday: from February 21 to March 1;â¢ Easter holiday: from April 4 to April 17;â¢ Long weekend: from May 1 to May 3, around the public holiday of May 1;â¢ Long weekend: from May 21 to May 24, around the public holiday of May 21;â¢ Long weekend: from May 30 to June 1, around the public holiday of June 1.From July 1 to August 31 schools are closed for the summer holidays.We used influenza surveillance data collected by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health [91] . Data report new ILI episodes registered each week by the network of sentinel general practitioners (GP). ILI is defined as sudden onset of symptoms, high fever, respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat) and systemic symptoms (headache, muscular pain). For every episode, additional information is reported: age group (<5, 5-14, 15-64, 65-84, 85+), hospitalization, antiviral treatment, vaccination status, municipality of residence. The use of ILI surveillance data to approximate influenza incidence is a usual practice [81, 96, 56] and in the case of Belgium previous work showed good agreement of ILI data with virological data [16] and robustness across different surveillance systems [92] . Surveillance data on the new number of cases were aggregated at the district level to reduce signal noise.The metapopulation model was calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. Though the simulated dynamics is spatially explicit, calibration was performed on Brussels district only, i.e. by comparing the simulated incidence profile of Brussels to the incidence ILI data for that district. We did not consider calibrating the model also in the remaining districts, as these were used for validation.The model was seeded with the first non-zero incidence value provided by surveillance data per district and accounted for possible sampling biases. We used a bootstap/particle filter Weighted Least Square (W LS) with 20 particles to calibrate our model fixing the epidemiological parameters described in paragraph 2.1.2 and obtain the per-contact transmissibility Î². Calibration was performed on normalized incidence curves to discount effects due to unknown GP consultation rates.To assess the impact of variations in contacts and mobility due to school closures, we compared the realistic model based on the Belgian school calendar and integrating the changes described in paragraph 2.1.4 with a set of experimental scenarios that we describe here. 11 All rights reserved.

In addition, we tested the w/o holiday model, where all holiday periods of the calendar are removed, and only the week structure is kept. We also considered a synthetic scenario where we extended the Christmas holiday of one week, before the start of the break, or after its end, referred to as the Christmas holiday extension models.To assess the interplay between the timing of the epidemic and that of the holiday periods, we considered anticipation and delays of the start of the epidemic season, as follows:â¢ the 4 weeks anticipation model (â4w ), where the start of the simulated influenza epidemic is anticipated 4 weeks prior to the start of the realistic model calibrated on the empirical data;â¢ the 2 weeks anticipation model (â2w ), as above with an anticipation of 2 weeks;â¢ the 2 weeks delay model (+2w ), as above with a delay of 2 weeks;â¢ the 4 weeks delay model (+4w ), as above with a delay of 4 weeks.In all these cases, the start of the epidemic is the only aspect that is being altered, whereas the school calendar (and associated variations in social mixing and travel behavior) remains fixed.We analyzed the spatial distribution of the force of infection determined by the demographic profile in space. To do so, we studied the distribution of the patch reproductive number R p that can be calculated as the largest eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix [38, 97] . This is done for the four types of days considered in terms of their variations of social mixing, namely regular weekday, regular weekend, holiday weekday, and holiday weekend.Validation of the model is performed by comparing the simulated incidence profiles to the empirical surveillance data at the national and at the district level. In particular, we looked at the peak difference per district d per stochastic run r:where T d (r) is the peak time of weekly incidence of run r in district d and T d ILI is the incidence peak reported from surveillance data in the same district. Medians per patch over 2 Â· 10 3 stochastic runs are computed. Scenario analyses are performed in order to assess the difference of an experimental scenario with the realistic model. We quantified the various comparisons in terms of:â¢ the peak time difference per patch âT p = T p scenario â T p realistic model , with T p the median peak time of the incidence curve in patch p computed on all stochastic runs (for both the scenario under study and the realistic model);â¢ the peak incidence relative variation per patch âI p = (I p scenario â I p realistic model ) /I p realistic model , with I p the median incidence value at peak time in patch p;â¢ the epidemic size relative variation per patch âÏ p = (Ï p scenario â Ï p realistic model ) /Ï p realistic model , with Ï p the median epidemic size in patch p.Medians and 50%, 95% confidence intervals at the patch levels are computed for synthesis. In addition, medians, 50%, 95% confidence intervals of the simulated incidence ate also calculated at the national level across the tested scenarios.Season 2008/2009 shows an ILI incidence that reaches its peak in week 5 of 2009, both in Brussels district and at the national level. The incidence is visibly slowed down during Christmas holiday (Figure 2) , suggesting that holiday periods may have a measurable effect on transmission. The simulated peak time is found to be within one week of the empirically observed time for 76% of the districts, and within two weeks for 90% of them. Only two districts in the Province of Luxembourg showed greater discrepancies (four weeks). We observed a mild tendency towards a radial increase of the peak time difference from Brussels to the edge of the country, with 4 weeks difference obtained on the border between Belgium and Luxembourg.The average patch reproductive number is estimated to be R = 2.12, corresponding to Î² = 0.0850 ([0.0674, 0.0858] 95% confidence interval (CI)) of the per-contact transmissibility obtained from the calibration procedure (see Methods). The variation of R p at the patch level is given by the demographic profile of the population and its immunity profile. In addition, it also depends on the day type considered, whether regular or during a holiday, whether during the week or the weekend (Figure 2 ). Larger variations and higher values are obtained for a regular weekday, having the largest number of contacts, compared to less heterogeneous distributions and smaller R p values 14 All rights reserved.

The patch reproductive number is lowest for the holiday weekend, corresponding to the lowest mixing.To assess the impact that changes in the social mixing or travel behaviors of individuals have on the epidemic outcome, we tested different experimental scenarios where we independently singled out these aspects. These scenarios 15 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Changes in individual behavior induced by weekends and holidays are found to strongly alter the epidemic dynamics leading to a considerable delay of the peak time (median of 3.7 weeks across patches, regular weekday model compared to the realistic model, Figure 3b ) and smaller peak time incidence (33% median relative change, Figure 3d ) and total epidemic size (11% median relative change, Figure 3c ).Once the variations in individual behavior affecting social mixing or mobility are considered in isolation, social mixing variation during weekends and holidays is found to be mainly responsible for the effects just described. The travel changes model is indeed comparable to the regular weekday model, whereas neglecting changes in mobility (mixing changes model) produces epidemic patterns very similar to the realistic model (zero median variations).The school calendar in Belgium during the influenza season counts four long holiday periods: Fall holiday, Christmas holiday, Winter holiday, Easter holiday (see Methods). Cumulatively, all holidays concur to delay the peak time of 1.7 weeks and to reduce the epidemic size of approximately 2%, with a reduction of the peak incidence (4%, all median values across patches, Figure 4 ). Among all holiday periods, the largest effect is produced by the Christmas holiday, responsible for the overall reduction of the epidemic size and a peak delay of about 1 week. The early break of Fall holiday has negligible impact instead. Winter holiday leads to a very small reduction of the epidemic size (median of 1%), but no effect on the peak timing or peak incidence. The impact of Easter holiday is negligible on all indicators. By comparing the effect of the regular weekday model (Figure 3 ) with the one of the w/o holiday model (Figure 4) , both on the realistic model, we find that weekends have a major effect in slowing down the epidemic curve: a difference of âT p = â3.7, [â3.9, â3.6] weeks when no weekends are considered compared to âT p = â1.7, [â1.9, â1.2] weeks when they are included.Given the major role of Christmas holiday, we also tested the effect of 1-week extension, before or after the break. The extension before Christmas holidays does not impact the resulting epidemic (Figure 4 , panels d-e-f). If the additional week of holiday is considered after the break, no changes to the epidemic timing are observed, however the incidence at the peak decreases of 4% (median values), respectively.

Boxplots refer to the distributions across patches.Christmas holidays are found to be the school closure period with the highest impact on the epidemic outcome, on both its timing and burden, for the 2008/2009 influenza season. Here we assess how this result may vary depending on the timing of the season, by investigating its interplay with the school closure calendar. In order to distinguish between effects induced by the timing of the in-18 All rights reserved.

We explored anticipations and delays of this epidemic of two or four weeks and compared the results with the realistic model.The strongest impact is observed for the earliest epidemic (â4w model) reporting a median anticipation of more than one week with respect to the realistic model (once discounted for the earlier start) and a median reduction of the peak incidence of about 10% ( Figure 5 ). All other epidemics are rather similar to the realistic one, except for the â2w model reporting a considerable reduction of the peak incidence (median of approximately 13% across patches). In addition, it is important to note that, differently from previous effects, the anticipation or delay of the season leads to a considerably larger variation of the simulated epidemic indicators across patches, signaled by the larger confidence intervals reported in Fig. 5 . In this study, we considered the impact of regular school closure on the spatio-temporal spreading pattern of seasonal influenza. We focused on the case study of the 2008/2009 influenza season in Belgium. We used a spatial metapopulation model for the transmission of influenza in the country, based on data on contacts and mobility of individuals, and integrating data-driven changes in mixing and travel behavior during weekends and holiday periods. The model calibrated on a single district (i.e. a subset of patches, â¼ 3% of the country total) is able to reproduce with fairly good agreement the empirical pattern observed in the country for that season, suggesting that data-driven mixing and mobility are crucial ingredients to capture influenza spatial dynamics [94, 18, 36, 10, 79, 39, 4, 26, 45] . The result is a spatially heterogeneous propagation where the two ingredients act at different levels.Mixing is patch-dependent and determined by the local demography. The large variations observed in the distribution of children vs. adults lead to heterogeneous distributions of the values of the reproductive numbers per patch. In specific mixing conditions -e.g. those of a holiday weekenda large fraction of patches has R p 1, indicating that those locations are found to be close to the critical conditions for epidemic extinction. Influenza is mainly sustained in patches having larger R p during those periods, and epidemic activity is then transferred to other patches through the mobility of infected individuals. Three-fourth of Belgian districts reach their epidemic peak in the simulations within one week of the empirical peak time. Districts exhibiting greater delays lie on the border of the country. This may be due to the model neglecting the mobility coupling between these regions and the neighboring countries, which is considerably large in some districts (e.g. the flux of individuals of the Luxembourg province commuting abroad represents almost 40% of the total flux of commuters of the district). Our study considered the country to be isolated for the sake of simplicity. We expect this border effect to be increasingly negligible for larger countries.The simulated incidence profile clearly shows a slowing down in the growth of the number of new infections during the Christmas break, as reported by sentinel surveillance in the country, suggesting that holiday is associated to temporary reductions in influenza transmission. This was also found in previous empirical studies [23, 45] . To identify the mechanisms behind this effect, we isolated the changes in mixing and those in travel behavior during school closure, comparing different experimental scenarios, similar to Ewing 20 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/230565 doi: bioRxiv preprint et al. [45] . We found that mixing changes during weekends and holidays lead to a considerable delay of the epidemic, whereas travel changes would produce no noticeable effect. Moreover, changes in the social contacts would explain the entire difference observed between the realistic model based on the calendar and a model that does not include school closure. This confirms prior modeling findings on winter holidays for several influenza seasons in the United States [45] . In contrast to that work, we found however that an important mitigation of the epidemic impact at peak time also occurs, besides the peak delay.The strong impact of the variation of mixing behavior is easily interpretable in terms of the reduction of the transmission potential expressed by the reproductive numbers per patch. This mainly results from the reduction of the number of contacts between children, as measured by the social contact survey conducted once schools are closed [61] . Travel changes, on the other hand, do not act directly on the transmission potential but affect the coupling force between epidemics in different patches and the opportunity for individuals to be exposed to the disease. For this reason, changes in travel behavior have a smaller effect that is found to be negligible for influenza epidemic spread, as also observed in the work of [45] . This is also consistent with the large literature on travel restrictions showing the little or no effect that these interventions have on pandemic spatial spread [32, 63, 46, 31, 44, 11, 18, 7, 84] . In addition to holidays, we also found that the closure of school during weekends has a visible effect on the epidemic, periodically dampening transmission, similarly to what observed in [90] . This is generally not reported by influenza surveillance systems, as data are collected on a weekly basis.For the 2008/2009 influenza season we found that Christmas holiday, occurring during a growing phase of influenza activity, is the school break responsible for the largest impact in terms of timing (about 1 week anticipation if holiday is not observed), along with a 5% reduction of the epidemic size. If the school break occurs earlier (as for the Fall holiday) or much later in the influenza season (e.g. Easter holiday), no effect is produced on the resulting epidemic. The case of Winter holidays occurring during the fadeout of the epidemic shows that a small reduction of the total number of cases can still be achieved with school closure after the epidemic peak, whereas other studies showed minimal impact [45] .The analysis on a single season illustrates well how the epidemic impact of school closure depends on the interplay between closure timing and in-fluenza season. By systematically exploring this interplay through synthetic scenarios, we confirm the importance of Christmas holiday in mitigating the influenza epidemic. Most importantly, we found that the break would have the largest impact for a very early season when school closing would occur at or around the epidemic peak. Reduction in transmission due to fewer contacts leads to a strong reduction of the incidence and ultimately of the total epidemic size, as also observed in pandemic settings [69] . In the other synthetic influenza seasons explored, a rebound effect was obtained when schools reopened after the break, most notably for the early season anticipating of two weeks the 2008/2009 influenza epidemic (-2w model). This was previously observed in other contexts [60, 48, 17, 8, 14, 62, 6, 35] , also when no additional interventions beyond school closure were considered [48, 62] . The various tested scenarios show that Christmas break would have a larger mitigating impact if it occurs before (or around) the peak and when the incidence is about half the peak value or larger.Our investigation shows that the role of holiday timing can be hardly inferred from few examples, and that other breaks beyond Christmas [45] may have an important mitigating impact. Also, the effect of a sequence of holidays occurring in an influenza season cannot be simply derived as a sum of the effects of each holiday period considered separately. Each break indeed affects the epidemic in a different way, altering its subsequent evolution in a non-linear way, so that the full calendar needs to be considered. Our findings help shedding light on previous empirical findings showing no clear pattern for the effects of school closure on peak incidence or total epidemic size, comparing closures before and after the peak [69] .In addition to school breaks already occurring in the calendar, we also explored a possible extension of Christmas holiday of one week. We chose this break as it led to the largest epidemic impact in our case study, and also because it generally occurs before the influenza epidemic peak (this is the case for all influenza seasons from the studied season to the current one, pandemic season excluded). As such, we expect it could have a favorable impact on the epidemic outcome in the majority of influenza seasons. Previous work analyzing the length of school closure found that two weeks or more appear to be enough to result in a recognizable effect [48, 62, 23, 99, 6] , whereas shorter closures may not be beneficial or may not have an obvious impact [37, 34, 70, 86, 19] . Our synthetic results show that the extension would be advantageous only if implemented after the Christmas break, with a mitigation of the peak incidence and a minimal peak delay of a few days. Extensions are generally considered in the realm of reactive closures against a pandemic influenza.Here we decided to test this scenario as a regular closure given that -in a broader context -authorities in Belgium are currently discussing whether to modify the school calendar for pedagogical reasons: the aim would be to reduce summer holidays and redistribute holiday periods throughout the year [54] . We found that an extension of the Christmas holiday would be beneficial in the management of the influenza season potentially mitigating its epidemic impact.Our findings are obtained on seasonal influenza, and results on peak delay were also recovered by modeling works on synthetic influenza pandemics considering reactive school closure [79] . The straightforward extension of our conclusions to the pandemic case faces however several challenges. First, effects induced by school closure may be specific to the specific epidemic profile, and therefore they may lead to different results depending on the pandemic under consideration [22] . For example, beneficial effects of school closure during 2009 H1N1 pandemic may have resulted from the larger magnitude of children attack rates vs. adults. Epidemic contexts more homogeneously impacting age classes may be less affected by school closure. Second, the nature of the school closure may alter the behavior of individuals during that period. In our study we considered holidays that are regularly planned in the school calendar and associated to specific social activities (e.g. vacation trips, family visits and others), for which contact data are available [61] . School closure during an influenza pandemic may be envisioned as a proactive or reactive measure to the ongoing outbreak. Not being planned, it is expected to have a stronger disruptive impact on social mixing of individuals on the short term compared to regular closure. On the other hand, it is argued that prolonged closure may limit the reduction of contacts on the long term, because of costs and logistics, and reduction in compliance rate [23, 22] . Having shown here that changes in social mixing represent the single element critically responsible for the impact of school closure on the epidemic outcome, we note that modeling results on school closure in the case of a pandemic would strongly be affected by assumptions considered for mixing changes, in absence of data.While a large body of literature has recently focused on behavioral changes during an epidemic [51, 83, 85, 50, 93] , still little is known to quantify them [68, 39, 61, 41, 40, 101, 102, 27, 77] . Our work focused on Belgium, as a rather detailed survey was conducted in the country to estimate contact rates in the population of different age classes at different periods of the calendar year [61] . These estimates constituted the input data to parameterize our spatial modeling framework. Modeling approaches to study epidemics in settings where no data exist are often based on the assumption that mixing would reduce following school closure and import estimates available from other settings or epidemiological contexts [79, 49, 45] . This may lead to several issues. Contacts and their changes along the calendar may be country-specific [80] , thus affecting epidemic results when applied to a different context. Estimates of the overall reduction of the number of contacts during school closure vary widely. Transmission models fitted to epidemic data estimated reductions ranging from 16-18% for holidays during seasonal influenza in France [23] , to 25% in Hong Kong for proactive school closure during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [99] , to 30% for the social distancing interventions (including school closure) implemented in Mexico following the start of 2009 pandemic [28] . A large-scale population-based prospective survey in Europe estimated the changes in contact patterns for holiday versus regular period to correspond to a reduction in the reproductive number as high as 33% for some countries, whereas for others no significant decrease was observed [61] . Finally, such overall reduction does not allow to fully parametrize a contact matrix. Such evidence does not support the parameterization of mixing changes from different countries and/or epidemic situations (e.g. seasonal vs. pandemic) [45] . The reduction is expected to be heterogeneous across mixing groups, because of compensatory behaviors (e.g. children drastically reduce children-children contacts but increase childrenadults contacts during holidays) [61, 40] . Assumptions on the relative role of specific age classes in absence of data may lead to biases in the modeled epidemic outcome, especially for epidemics reporting large differences in attack rates in children vs. adults. Our work highlights the need to expand our knowledge on contacts and associated changes induced by social activity or by the epidemic itself, in order to better parameterize models and provide reliable and accurate results for epidemic management.Our study has a set of limitations that we discuss in the following. The host population is divided into two classes only. While a larger heterogeneity is known for the distribution of contacts across age classes [80] , our approach still accounts for the major role of children vs. adults in the spread of the disease. Moreover, the validation analysis shows that considering children and adults and the associated mixing and travel behavior is enough to reproduce the spatio-temporal unfolding of the epidemic to a good accuracy. Also, we did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic infec-tions. Santermans et al. [87] investigated the importance of dealing with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in an epidemic setting based on differences in mixing patterns between ill and healthy (as a proxy for asymptomatic) individuals. Future research should focus on combining the work of [87] with the study outlined here.The study is focused on one season only, the 2008/2009 influenza season. Additional seasons may clearly be included in the analysis, however our choice aimed at discounting season-specific effects to avoid uncertainties and discordance found in previous works. Also, we argue that the main effect behind the observed impact is in the interplay between the incidence profile and holidays timing, all other aspects being equal. To fully assess this aspect, we systematically explored earlier and later epidemics than the 2008/2009 season, thus synthetically accounting for other (similar) influenza seasons. We did not consider age-specific susceptibility, as it was largely addressed for example in studies related to the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic [21] . It would be interesting to explore its effects in future work in addition to social mixing and mobility, thus investigating additional seasonal influenza profiles.Our experimental scenarios in travel changes and mixing changes models consider neglecting travel changes and mixing changes in an independent way. The two aspects are expected to be intrinsically dependent, however no study has yet quantified this dependency that could inform a better experimental design. Also, we did not take into account uncertainties associated to the social contact rates estimated from the survey data, as previous work showed their limited impact in fitting serological data [55] .Mobility changes from commuting during regular weekdays to non-regular travel during weekends is obtained from travel statistics. We lack however specific data on travel behavior for adults during school holidays. We therefore assumed that adults would continue commuting during holiday weekdays. While we expect that a fraction of adults would stop commuting at least for few days during breaks as they take time off work, we expect this change in travel fluxes (compensated by additional trips to visit families [45] ) to have a negligible effect on the simulated epidemic. More drastic changes on travel, i.e. fully neglecting travel changes as in the mixing changes model, indeed did not alter the resulting epidemic.25 All rights reserved.

This may help the management of epidemics and lessen the pressure on the public health infrastructure. The effect is due to both school holidays and weekend closures, the latter periodically dampening transmission. Variations in travel behavior do not lead instead to visible effects. The observed impact strongly depends on the timing of the school closure, and to a lesser extent on its duration. Christmas holiday is the school break generally playing the most important role in mitigating the epidemic course, though variations are observed depending on the influenza season (e.g. early vs. late epidemic). The addition of one week extension after Christmas holiday may represent an additional strategy to further delay the epidemic peak and mitigate its impact.Abbreviations ILI: influenza-like-illness; SEIR: Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered; WLS: Weighted Least Square; GP: general practitioner; CI: confidence interval.Commuting data is available upon request from the Directorate General Statistics and Economic Information (DGSEI) [66] .

Agrobacterium-mediated delivery, similarly, is also limited to use in certain plant species, often yields random DNA integration that can adversely and unpredictably affect the cell operation (15) , results in constitutive expression of siRNA thus limiting temporal control over gene silencing, and can be difficult to scale or multiplex for high-throughput or multi-gene target applications, respectively (16) .While nanomaterial-mediated delivery of RNA and therapeutics has been extensively explored in animals (17) (18) (19) , its potential for plant systems remains understudied (20) . Several prior studies take advantage of nanomaterials to deliver plasmid DNA (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) or proteins (26) to intact plant cells. Polymeric nanoparticles have shown promise for siRNA delivery to cell wall-free plant protoplasts, but polymeric nanoparticles have not been shown to traverse the cell wall for gene silencing in intact plant cells (13) . A recent study has shown that clay nanosheets can facilitate delivery of pathogen-specific double-stranded RNA into intact plant cells for virus resistance (27) .Topical application of clay nanosheets enabled silencing of homologous RNA to provide sustained 20-day viral protection on the leaf surface.

In this study, we demonstrate the delivery of a different RNAi molecule -single-stranded siRNA -into intact cells of plant leaves using high-aspect-ratio one dimensional carbon nanomaterials: singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). SWNTs are biocompatible allotropes of carbon that have a high aspect ratio cylindrical nanostructure with diameters of 0.8-1.2 nm and lengths of 500-1000 nm. SWNTs are capable of passively crossing the extracted chloroplast envelope (28) and plant cell membranes (29) due to their high aspect ratio morphology, uniquely high stiffness, and small dimensions. SWNTs are among the few nanomaterials that can be synthesized to have a smallest dimension (~ 1 nm) below the plant size exclusion limit of ~20 nm, while also providing a large cylindrical surface area from the extrusion of their 1-dimension out to ~ 500 nm. The resulting large surface area to volume ratio is thus amenable to facile loading of appreciable quantities of biological cargoes such as siRNA. In contrast, spherical nanoparticles must often exceed the plant cell wall size exclusion limit to load necessary quantities of bio-cargoes, due to the reduced scaling of the spherical nanoparticle surface area to volume. Furthermore, when bound to SWNTs, biomolecules are protected from degradation in mammalian systems (30) , exhibiting superior biostability compared to free biomolecules; a phenomenon we show herein can extend to plants. Moreover, SWNTs have strong intrinsic near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence (31, 32) within the biological tissuetransparency window and beyond the chlorophyll autofluorescence range, and thus enable tracking of cargo-nanoparticle complexes deep in plant tissues.Prior usage of SWNTs in plant systems is limited to studies of SWNT biocompatibility (28, 33, 34) , sensing of small molecules (29, 35, 36) , and for delivery of All rights reserved.

To-date, there has yet to be a nanoparticle-based delivery platform for siRNA molecules into intact plant cells. Herein, we develop a SWNT-based siRNA delivery platform for the efficient silencing of an endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene in plant leaves. We show that SWNTs enable passive delivery (without external mechanical aid) and fluorescent-tracking of siRNA molecules in plant tissues. SWNTs present a non-toxic platform for siRNA delivery that uses a minimal siRNA dose to achieve silencing for up to 7 days, whereby silencing can be sustained upon re-infiltration of the siRNA-SWNT dose. With SWNT-mediated siRNA delivery, we achieve 95% gene silencing efficiency at the mRNA level, and show a significant delay in siRNA nuclease degradation in cells, and also at the single-molecule level, through protection by SWNTs. Taken altogether, SWNT-based delivery platform is rapid, scalable, facile to multiplex for multiple gene silencing targets, and speciesindependent (24, 33, (37) (38) (39) . In sum, this study establishes that SWNTs could be a promising resource to overcome plant RNA delivery limitations, and could enable a variety of plant biotechnology applications based on RNAi.In this study, we aim to validate SWNTs as a passive and effective siRNA delivery and gene silencing platform for use in intact cells of mature plants.

Herein, we tested two separate siRNA sequences (a-siRNA and b-siRNA) which target two slightly different regions of the mGFP5 gene for GFP silencing (Fig. 1a) .Loading of siRNA on SWNTs was accomplished by probe-tip sonication of each siRNA single-strand (sense, and separately antisense) with pristine SWNTs for both a-siRNA and b-siRNA sequences (Fig. 1b) . With this method, sense and antisense strands of siRNA were non-covalently adsorbed on SWNTs via Ï -Ï stacking of RNA nitrogen bases with the Ï bonds of sp 2 -hybridized carbons in SWNTs. The adsorption of RNA on SWNTs was confirmed for each sequence (a-antisense-SWNT, a-sense-SWNT, b-antisense-SWNT and b-sense SWNT) through the emergence of characteristic peaks in the individually-suspended SWNT absorbance (Fig. 1c) and nIR fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 1d) . We hypothesize and later verify that upon infiltration of an equimolar mixture of sense and antisense suspended SWNTs, these complementary siRNA strands desorb from the SWNT surface and hybridize to each other inside plant cells to form the active double-stranded siRNA silencing complex.

Successful suspension of SWNTs with non-targeting RNA sense and antisense strands was confirmed by absorbance and fluorescence spectra of individually suspended s-RNA-SWNTs Nb leaves were imaged with confocal microscopy to quantify Cy3 fluorescence inside leaf cells and in the extracellular area. In plants, the cytosol is pushed to the cell periphery due to the presence of a large central vacuole. Leaves infiltrated with Cy3-RNA-SWNTs showed a high degree of co-localization (70% Â± 8%, mean Â± SD) between the intracellular (cytosolic) GFP and Cy3 fluorescence originating from the nanocarriers, which confirms efficient internalization of RNA-SWNTs into intact cells (Fig. 2b ).

Additional confocal images of Cy3-RNA-SWNT and Cy3-RNA infiltrated leaves with representative higher and lower co-localization percentages are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2 . As a note here, a typical plant cell contains an organelle called vacuole, which is filled with water and occupies 80% of the cell volume.Therefore, any fluorescence localized in the cytoplasm follows the cytosolic cell contour shape ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).To investigate the effect of SWNT length on the cell internalization efficiency, we prepared short SWNTs through excessive probe-tip sonication. AFM images revealed that these short SWNTs have an average length of 250 nm; they are significantly shorter than SWNTs obtained with regular preparation (776 nm). We then loaded these short SWNTs with Cy3-RNA as before and checked internalization efficiency into GFP benthamiana cells with confocal microscopy. Interestingly, we found that short SWNTs have lower plant cell internalization efficiency compared to the longer ones, shown by respective average co-localization percentages of 47% and 70% ( Supplementary Fig.   4 ).

Following 6 hours of incubation, we imaged the infiltrated leaves with a custom-built nIR microscope equipped with a Raptor Ninox VIS-SWIR 640 camera, a 721 nm SWNT excitation laser, and a white lamp and appropriate filters to image GFP (see Methods). In leaves infiltrated with ssRNA-SWNTs, commensurate with Cy3-tagged confocal imaging results, we observe a high degree of co-localization between intracellular GFP and the nIR fluorescence of SWNTs (36, 43, 44) .After confirming that ssRNA adsorbed SWNTs can efficiently be uptaken by plant cells, we analyzed the thermodynamics of sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface, and their subsequent propensities for hybridization in the extracellular and intracellular conditions. According to our analysis (Supplementary Information), in the in vitro and extracellular area of the leaf tissue, sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface and hybridization is not thermodynamically favorable (âG>0), due to a high free energy cost of bare SWNTs in an aqueous All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564427 doi: bioRxiv preprint environment (Fig. 3a) . This unfavorable RNA desorption energy facilitates maintenance of intact RNA-SWNT conjugates in the extracellular environment until RNA-SWNTs enter cells. Once intracellular, sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface and hybridization is thermodynamically favorable (âG<0) because intracellular proteins, lipids, and other membrane and cytosolic biomolecules can occupy the SWNT surface and lower the associated free energy costs of RNA desorption (Fig. 3b ).Hybridization and desorption of sense and antisense RNA strands is verified with an in vitro experiment, where we mixed and incubated an equimolar mixture of a-sense-SWNT and a-antisense-SWNT suspensions for 3 h at room temperature; either in water or in plant cell lysate solution ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). We then eluted the desorbed siRNA and quantified it via absorbance at 260 nm. The results confirm that an insignificant amount of siRNA is desorbed when RNA-SWNTs incubated in water, whereas 66% of the siRNA is desorbed when incubated in plant cell lysate solution. We then ran the eluted RNA from the cell lysate sample on an agarose gel and showed that it is double-stranded, which verifies the formation of double-stranded siRNA in the cell cytosol. Additionally, zeta potential measurements of a-siRNA-SWNTs before and after hybridization in water and removal of desorbed RNA show unchanged nanoparticle zeta potential, suggesting there is not significant amount of RNA hybridizing and desorbing from SWNT surface in water ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

We have shown that 100 nM siRNA on SWNTs is an optimal dose to be used in mGFP5 silencing studies ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Transgenic Nb leaves that constitutively express GFP were imaged via confocal microscopy to quantify GFP silencing at the protein level. Representative confocal images of the leaves 2-days postinfiltration reveals that both a-siRNA-SWNTs and b-siRNA-SWNTs lead to significant reduction of GFP in cells, whereas GFP expression in leaves infiltrated with s-RNA-SWNT and free siRNA appears similar to GFP expression in non-treated leaves (Fig.   4a ). Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity from the confocal images of s-RNA-SWNTs and a-siRNA-SWNTs (see Methods) reveals that a-siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves have 38% Â± 3.2% (mean Â± SD) less GFP protein 3-days post-infiltration compared to the s-RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves. At 7-days post-infiltration, a-siRNA-SWNT shows roughly the same amount of GFP, 106.6 Â± 4.1% (mean Â± SD), as s-RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves (Fig. 4b) , as expected since gene silencing with siRNA is a transient process. GFP silencing with a-siRNA-SWNT was also verified with a Western blot analysis, where GFP extracted from the Nb leaves infiltrated with a-siRNA-SWNT is All rights reserved.

One day after infiltration of leaves with s-RNA-SWNT, free siRNA, a-siRNA-SWNT, and b-siRNA-SWNT, we extracted total RNA from the leaves and quantified the GFP mRNA transcript levels in each sample at Day 1 and 7. qPCR demonstrates that s-RNA-SWNT and free siRNA infiltrated leaves have the same amount of GFP mRNA transcript as the non-treated leaf, whereby a-siRNA-SWNT and b-siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves show 95% Â± 4.1% (mean Â± SD) and 92% Â± 6.2% (mean Â± SD) reduction in the GFP mRNA transcript levels at Day 1, respectively (Fig. 4d) . Similar to the confocal results, we found that mRNA transcript levels return back to the baseline levels as observed in non-treated leaves by Day 7 in all samples as a result of transient silencing (Fig. 4d) . Additionally, we show that we can recover GFP silencing at Day 7 by up to 71% Â± 2.9% (mean Â± SD) by re-infiltrating the leaf with second 100 nM a-siRNA-SWNT dose at Day 5 (Fig. 4e ). With the same technique, we also demonstrated the silencing of a functional endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene called ROQ1, which has implications in disease resistance against many pathogens (45) ( Supplementary   Fig. 8 ). Our results verify that SWNTs can also silence endogenous plant genes efficiently.All rights reserved.

To explore this hypothesis, we performed single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy to probe single siRNA strand susceptibility to degradation by RNase A when adsorbed on SWNTs, compared to single free siRNA. To do so, we labeled the a-antisense strand of GFP siRNA with a 5' terminal Cy3 fluorophore, and immobilized RNA-Cy3 and RNA-Cy3-SWNTs onto parallel channels of a microfluidic slide (see Methods). We measured the Cy3 fluorescence in each channel before and after treatment with RNase A, whereby percent decrease in the number of Cy3 molecules was used as a proxy for the percent siRNA degraded (Fig. 5a) . Our TIRF results show that 98% Â± 0.3% (mean Â± SD) of the initial Cy3-RNA immobilized on the channel surface is degraded after incubation with RNase A, whereas only 16% Â± 4.9% (mean Â± SD) of Cy3-RNA is degraded when it is bound to SWNTs, suggesting that SWNTs protect the siRNA cargo from enzymatic degradation inside cells (Fig. 5b) .

Agarose gel electrophoresis of free ssRNA vs. ssRNA-SWNTs incubated in plant cell lysate for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours demonstrate that free ssRNA is degraded significantly faster in cells compared to ssRNA adsorbed on SWNTs (Fig. 5c) . Band intensity quantification of agarose gel reveals that upon starting with 200 ng ssRNA, free ssRNA is completely degraded within 12 hours, whereas the ssRNA on the SWNTs is only completely degraded after 24 hours (Fig. 5d and 5e) , which corresponds to a 12 hour increase in the residence time of siRNA strands in cells when delivered through SWNTs. This gives rise to prolonged and increased silencing efficiency, as siRNA strands in cells have higher chance of hybridizing into the active complex before getting degraded by plant nucleases. With a similar in vitro cell lysate degradation experiment, we also show that after hybridization and desorption, double-stranded siRNA has high stability and it persists in cells for more than 4-days after formulation ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).SWNT biocompatibility, at the concentrations used in this study, was tested by qPCR analysis of a commonly used stress gene, and by tissue damage analysis via confocal microscopy. For qPCR toxicity analysis, we checked the upregulation of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog B (NbrbohB) gene (Fig. 5f ). NbrbohB upregulation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves represents stress response to many factors such as mechanical, light or heat damage (46) . qPCR results show that 2 mg/L RNA-SWNT All rights reserved.

Given the unchanged expression levels of stress gene NbrbohB, and healthy leaf tissue of RNA-SWNT infiltrated plants, we can conclude that 2 mg/L RNA-SWNTs are biocompatible for in planta RNAi applications.

We demonstrate here that high-aspect-ratio one dimensional SWNTs can successfully deliver siRNA molecules to efficiently silence a GFP gene in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana mature plant leaves, through a combination of i) effective intracellular delivery and ii) protection of the siRNA cargo from nuclease degradation. We found that RNA adsorbed SWNTs rapidly and efficiently internalize into the full leaf thickness of mature walled plant cells within 6 hours, in contrast to free RNA internalization which is minimal. We further found that Ï -Ï adsorption of siRNA on the SWNT surface delays intracellular siRNA degradation and thus prolongs silencing.Here, we developed a platform for siRNA delivery using nanoparticles, well suited for cellular delivery in plant tissues with intact cell walls. This platform utilizes SWNTs, to which single-stranded sense and antisense siRNA are adsorbed separately, enabling thermodynamically-favorable siRNA hybridization once intracellular for subsequent gene silencing mechanisms. We show that ssRNA is protected from degradation for up to 24 hours when adsorbed to SWNTs, whereas free ssRNA is almost completely degraded by 6 hours. We show a similar siRNA protection phenomenon with single-molecule TIRF microscopy of individual siRNA molecules either free or adsorbed to SWNTs. With this rapid and facile SWNT delivery platform, we achieve transient and DNA-free silencing of genes in mature plant leaves with a low siRNA-SWNT dose, showing mRNA knockdown efficiencies of up to 95% within 1 day post-infiltration, returning to native transcript levels by day 7.

Applications that require the introduction of repeated doses of siRNA-SWNTs may cause some long-term toxicity due to the nanoparticle accumulation in cells.However, studies should be undertaken to investigate the long-term effects of SWNT accumulation in plant cells.The commonly used cationic nanoparticles for the delivery of negatively charged siRNA through electrostatic interactions have shown appreciable cellular toxicity to cells for certain effective concentrations and/or charge densities (47) . The pristine noncharged SWNT surface eliminates this problem and makes it possible to scale-up the delivery of siRNA for higher doses or systemic administration. Additionally, the platform could be adapted to loading multiple siRNA sequences to multiplex gene silencing targets by delivering a mixture of SWNTs suspended with multiple siRNA sequences or loading a single SWNT sample with multiple siRNA sequences. Furthermore, SWNT internalization and polynucleotide delivery into plants is hypothesized to be speciesindependent, can be used with monocots, non-model species, hard-to-transform species, and cargo-carrying SWNTs are expected to diffuse into the full thickness of leaves providing a uniform transformation profile (24) .Given aforementioned advantages, we believe that there is a broad range of applications of our siRNA delivery platform. The process of RNA adsorption to SWNTs is based on Ï -Ï adsorption and thus agnostic to the function of the RNA cargo.Additional to the more traditional applications of RNAi in plants, such as disease/virus resistance, discovery of biosynthetic pathways, increasing the yield of small-molecule All rights reserved.

For instance, SWNTs could aid nuclease-based genome editing in plants by delivery of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and/or messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for controlled and transient nuclease expression and subsequent genome editing. Another potential application of SWNT-based RNA delivery is for increasing homology-directed repair (HDR) rates in plants for gene knock-in applications, which could possibly be achieved by suppressing the expression of the genes required for competitive nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathways (48) . As the efficient suppression of these genes is only desirable for the few-day time window in which genome editing takes place, our SWNT-mediated gene silencing platform could enable such control over transient siRNA delivery. As such, SWNT-based delivery of polynucleic acids is a useful resource to expand the plant biotechnology toolkit.Preparation of chemicals.

Two-step qPCR was performed to quantify GFP gene silencing in transgenic Nb plants as described in (24) .The target gene in our qPCR was mGFP5 (GFP transgene inserted into Nb), and EF1(elongation factor 1) as our housekeeping (reference) gene. Primers for these genes can be found in Supplementary Table 3 . An annealing temperature of 60ËC and 40 cycles were used for qPCR. qPCR data was analyzed by the ddCt method (51) as described in (24) . For each sample, qPCR was performed as 3 reactions from the same isolated RNA batch, and the entire experiment consisting of independent infiltrations and RNA extractions from different plants was repeated 3 times (3 biological replicates).Single molecule TIRF to image RNA protection by SWNTs. The a-antisense siRNA strand was utilized in this assay. 10 Î¼M 5' labelled Cy3-RNA was added to an equal mass of SWNTs. The RNA-SWNT suspension and removal of unbound RNA followed the same protocol as described in 'Quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments for gene silencing'. The positive control comprised of the same sequence that was 5' Cy3 labeled, and 3' biotin labeled. 6-channel Î¼-slides (ibidi, Î¼-Slide VI 0.5 Glass Bottom) were initially washed by pipetting 100 Î¼L of 100 mM sterile NaCl solutions into one reservoir and removing 60 Î¼L the other end, leaving just enough solution to fully wet the channel.

Briefly, 50 Î¼L of 0.25 mg/mL BSA-Biotin was added to coat the surface of the glass slide for 5 minutes. Next, 50 Î¼L of 0.05 mg/mL NeutrAvidin was added, followed by 50 Î¼L of 1.0 mg/L RNA-SWNT, which non-specifically adsorbs to NeutrAvidin. For the positive control, 50 Î¼L of 200 pM biotinylated Cy3-RNA was added in place of RNA-SWNT. The addition of each component comprised of a 5-minute incubation period, followed by flushing the channel with 50 Î¼L of NaCl solution to remove specimens that were not surface-immobilized. Each channel was exposed to 50 Î¼L of 10 Î¼g/mL RNase A for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the channel with 50 Î¼L NaCl solution. Slides were imaged with a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 microscope immediately following incubation with RNase A.To determine if SWNT adsorbed RNA is protected from nuclease degradation, we performed an agarose gel electrophoresis based RNA protection assay as described in (24) . 200 ng free RNA and RNA-SWNTs (carrying 200 ng RNA) were each incubated with cell lysate proteins obtained from one Nb leaf to mimic the intracellular degradation conditions for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.After incubation in cell lysate, all RNA (intact or not) was desorbed from the SWNT surface by heating at 95ËC for 1 hour in 2% SDS and 1.5 M NaCl solution. Desorbed RNA and cell lysate treated free RNA were run on a 1% agarose gel with RNA standards (200, 100, and 50 ng) to measure the intact versus degraded RNA in each sample lane. RNA amounts on the agarose gel were quantified by using band intensity as a proxy (ImageJ Gel Analyzer) and normalized with the lanes containing known RNA quantities. All rights reserved.

Moreover, the 48 rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population typically accelerates 49 throughout an epidemic as awareness of the infectious threat increases, 8 a process Drake et al 50 referred to as \"societal learning.\" 9 Obtaining accurate estimates of this time-varying removal of 51infected persons, while difficult, improves the quality of compartmental models for epidemics 52 of infectious disease. 9,10 To our knowledge, however, no work has directly compared the rate of 53 behavioral adaption across multiple epidemics, societies, and geographic settings. 54 55Many factors can affect how quickly effective isolation practices are implemented, such as 56 access to health care, local public health funding, international aid, and the efficacy of 57 information campaigns. 11 Local health care practices and non-formal healthcare systems also 58 provide care to patients during epidemics and can play a part in quarantining infected 59individuals. 12 Previous work in Liberia has shown that a combination of these approaches 60 through simultaneous community engagement and clinical intervention is more effective than 61any single intervention, with both health care access and utilization increasing hand-in-hand to 62decrease EVD transmission during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. 13 While infection prevention 63often includes vaccination, progress to develop effective vaccines for emerging infections is 64 slow and not necessarily more effective than isolation of infected individuals. 14 Ring vaccination 65with the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine 15 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 66promising, 16 but previous work has suggested that ring vaccination may only provide a marginal 67 benefit to rigorous contact tracing and patient isolation. 17 68 69The focus of this paper is the identification of key similarities and differences in the behavioral 70 response to outbreaks of three emerging zoonotic infections. We sought to determine how the 71 mean removal rate of infected individuals changed over the course of each outbreak as 72 measured by epidemic week and viral serial interval. Individuals often experience zoonotic and 73 emerging infections as innately more frightening than \"familiar\" diseases, leading to rapid 74 behavioral adaptations due to high perceived risk. 18 We compiled data for each outbreak location binned by epidemic week, to produce comparable 97 data for regression analysis. Epidemic weeks came from weekly onset dates described above. 98We also binned the same data by serial interval, using 12 days as the estimated serial interval 99for Ebola, 23 8 days for SARS, 24 and 7 days for MERS; 27 this was calculated as epidemic 100week/(serial interval/7). Each dataset included, per week, the number of new cases, the 101 cumulative number of cases, mean DSOH and associated standard deviation, and MRR and 102 associated standard deviation. We removed epidemic weeks from the beginning of each 103 outbreak so that the first three epidemic weeks had greater than 0 cases of disease each in 104 order to focus on population-level behavioral adaptation to large-scale disease outbreaks 105instead of adaptations to individual disease events early in an epidemic. We performed all 106 regression analyses using this binned data. 107 108Initial regression analyses fit linear models to predict DSOH and MRR ( week) more than the 165 mean change in the 166 MRR of the Liberian 167Ebola epidemic (Fig.  168 2). The mean change 169 of the MRR in the 170Ebola epidemic in Lofa 171County, Liberia, was 172 significantly higher than the mean change of the MRR for the overall Liberian epidemic and the 173 .

The three MERS outbreaks (Riyadh, Jeddah, and South Korea) did not differ 175 significantly from one another and had limited precision (Fig. 2) . 176 177We narrowed the 195 associated confidence intervals (Fig. 2) . We identified little difference in the mean change of 196 the MRR for the Ebola outbreak depending on predictor (Fig. 2) While our findings demonstrate large and statistically significant differences in MRR, it is 231notable that the calculated rates of change in the MRRs are within a factor of ten (when 232 calculated using epidemic week) to seven (when calculated using serial interval) of each other 233 (Fig. 2) , with the mean change being the lowest in the EVD outbreak in Liberia and the highest 234in the MERS outbreak in South Korea. For modelers seeking to understand the epidemiology of 235 emerging infectious diseases with limited or no data from previous outbreaks, this study 236 provides a range of acceptable values for the MRR based on seven geographically distinct 237 outbreaks of three emerging diseases. Similarly, while large disparities in DSOH are obvious (Fig.  238 1), these data highlight that all societies quickly adapt to outbreaks of emerging infections. We have shown that public health practices for isolating infected individuals from the 249 susceptible population vary significantly by pathogen and location, but can in some cases be 250 predicted by the timing and serial interval of the epidemic. This study detected variation in 251 DSOH and MRR based on epidemic location and outbreak type, indicating that it may be 252 possible to estimate a general range of the rate of change in these variables over time. Due to 253location-specific differences in DSOH and MRR, modelers who seek to develop forecasts early in 254 an outbreak would benefit from estimating an expected range for removal of infected 255 individuals using data from past outbreaks of the same pathogen in a similar setting. 256Furthermore, the quality of these estimates will be impacted by the metric chosen, as seen by 257 the notable, but distinct, trends detected in DSOH and MRR. As seen in this study, utilizing a 258well-chosen response variable with a relatively small amount of data can provide material for 259making effective forecasts about public health behavior. \n","Humans astroviruses (HAstVs) belong to genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae.ORF1b (RdRp) amino acid sequences were extracted and aligned, and a phylogenetic tree constructed (Fig. S1 ). We follow the genogroups defined in Yokoyama et al. 8 . Although the more-divergent CP sequences may provide a less robust phylogenetic analysis, we also constructed a CP-based phylogenetic tree to test for possible recombination (Fig. S2 ). At the level of genogroup the ORF1b and CP trees were consistent, although within genogroups there were some differences between the topologies of the two trees. For simplicity, we used the ORF1b tree to define astrovirus clades for full-genome analyses.We grouped astrovirus sequences into clades (Fig. 1B) , generated codon-based alignments of concatenated ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2 coding sequences within each clade, and analyzed the alignments with synplot2 which tests for regions where synonymous substitutions occur less often than average for the sequence alignment 9 . Regions with significantly enhanced synonymous site conservation typically harbour overlapping functional elements which constraint sequence evolution 9 . The analysis of subgroup \"Ia\" astroviruses ( Fig. 1B ; classical HAstVs besides some feline and sea lion astroviruses) revealed conserved elements at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b (representing the ribosomal frameshifting signal and ORF1a/ORF1b overlap), upstream of ORF2 (presumed to represent elements involved in sgRNA synthesis), towards the 3â² end of ORF2 (possible replication elements), and overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 (the putative overlapping ORFX) (Fig. 1C) . We applied the same analysis to 13 other astrovirus genogroup or sub-genogroup clades, revealing conserved regions overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally (see below for exceptions), not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S3) .We repeated the synonymous site conservation analysis using clades, sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees based on only ORF2 in order to rule out potential artefacts as a result of possible recombination between the nonstructural and structural modules of the virus genome, and to include additional part-genome sequences (total 415 sequences with ORF2 coverage; Fig. 1D; Fig. S4 ). This analysis revealed conserved regions overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 throughout genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally, not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S5 ). Those clades with synonymous site conservation also contain a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF, whereas those sequences without synonymous site conservation generally also lacked a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5) .Interestingly, we also detected synonymous site conservation in two subgroups of genogroup II astroviruses ( Fig. S3G; Fig. S3H ). In subgroup \"IId\", the conservation coincided with a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5E) ; however in subgroup \"IIc\", there was no conserved ORF in the +1 reading frame. Instead, we observed an ORF in the â1 reading frame . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

It seems plausible that ORFX and ORFY in genogroup II astroviruses may have evolved independently of ORFX in other astrovirus genogroups (see Discussion).Evidence for ORFX was also found in a clade of rodent astroviruses of unassigned genogroup ( Fig. S3D; Fig. S5L ). Further, a number of unclustered divergent sequences also contain long +1 frame ORFs overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 that potentially encode XP proteins (Fig. S7 ).Note that genogroup V -represented by a single partial sequence, FJ890355 (bottlenose dolphin astrovirus 1) -is one of these. Table S1 ). Similar to other overlapping genes, which generally evolve de novo 11 , the XP peptide sequences show little to no homology to known protein domains. Many XP sequences contain a predicted TM domain, and some other XPs contain a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that resembles a TM domain despite being scored below threshold by Phobius (Fig. S8, Fig. S9 ).To test for XP expression in infected cells, we first raised various antibodies against XP peptides and we also tested the viability of tagged-XP viruses. However, neither antibody nor tagged virus approaches were successful. Thus we turned to ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq). Ribo-Seq is a high throughput sequencing technique that globally maps the footprints of initiating or elongating 80S ribosomes on mRNAs 12, 13 . We infected Caco2 cells and performed Ribo-Seq at 12 hours post infection (hpi). Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as previously described 14 (Fig.   S10 ). Using flash-freezing with no drug pre-treatment (NT), we mapped the translational landscape of the HAstV1 genome ( Fig. 2A) . ORF2 is translated at ~9ï´ the level of ORF1a, whereas ORF1b is translated at ~25% the level of ORF1a, indicating a ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of ~25%. The higher expression of ORF2 is likely a result of higher levels of sgRNA than gRNA in the translation pool. To identify translation initiation sites, we utilized the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM), which acts preferentially on the initiating ribosome but not on the elongating ribosome 15 . LTM binds to the 80S ribosome already assembled at the initiation codon and occupies the empty exit (E-site) of initiating ribosomes, thus completely blocking translocation. Using this approach, we confirm the two previously known initiation . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Such reads will not ligate to the adapter oligonucleotides and thus will be excluded from sequencing. This may explain why the ORF2 initiation peak is smaller than the ORF1a initiation peak, even though ORF2 is expressed at much higher levels than ORF1a. Thus we cannot quantify the ORF2:ORFX expression ratio from the LTM data.Ribosome profiling of eukaryotic systems typically has the characteristic that mappings of the 5â² end positions of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) to coding sequences reflect the triplet periodicity (herein referred to as \"phasing\") of genetic decoding. For our datasets, the great majority of RPF 5â² ends map to the first nucleotide of codons (Fig. 2C, left) . Reads mapping to the ORF2/ORFX part of the genome (NT samples) were quantified in the three possible phases.In the region of ORF2 that is overlapped by ORFX we observed an increased number of reads mapping in the +1 phase relative to the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 2C , middle) compared to the region of ORF2 that is not overlapped by ORFX (Fig. 2C , right) or the coding regions of host mRNAs (Fig. 2C, left) . Quantification of the differences in phasing indicated that ORFX is translated at ~27% of the level of ORF2, although it should be noted that reporter assays (see below) are expected to provide more accurate quantification than RPF phasing analysis.XP-knockout viruses are attenuated but pseudo-revert on passage.To evaluate the significance of ORFX in the context of virus infection, a set of mutant virus genomes was created based on the pAVIC1 infectious clone 16 by introducing mutations that knock out ORFX without affecting the CP amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) . Four independent mutations were introduced to guard against the possibility of affecting potential RNA secondary structures overlapping with this region, resulting in pAVIC1-AUGm (AUG to ACG), pAVIC1-PTC1 (stop codon after 20 amino acids), pAVIC1-2ÃPTC (double stop codon after 20 amino acids) and pAVIC1-PTC2 (stop codon after 73 amino acids) ( Fig. 3B; Fig. S11 ). Corresponding T7 RNA transcripts were used for virus rescue in Huh7.5.1 cells followed by infection in Caco2 cells. All four ORFX knockout viruses were strongly attenuated compared to wt virus (Fig. 3C ).After seven blind passages in Caco2 cells, two mutant viruses (pAVIC1-AUGm and pAVIC1-.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint PTC1) demonstrated an ï¾1 log increase in virus titers, which was achieved via a pseudoreversion (pAVIC1-AUGm) or 5 or 8 codon deletions (pAVIC1-PTC1) (Fig. 3C ). All three mutations would result in restoration of XP expression, confirming its importance in virus growth.XP is essential for virus release but has only a minor effect on RNA replication.ORFX overlaps ORF2, which encodes the structural polyprotein, and therefore the expression of XP is likely required in late stages of the virus replication cycle. To rule out the possibility of XP directly influencing viral RNA replication, we developed a replicon system comprising an intact astrovirus genome up to the end of ORFX, followed by a 2A-RLuc cassette fused in either the ORF2 or ORFX reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig. 4A) . These replicons provide a direct measurement of translated product associated with activity of the subgenomic promoter. Two ORFX knock-out mutations were copied in both versions of the replicon to evaluate the significance of XP for RNA replication (Fig. 4B ). Experiments were performed in BSR and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, both of which have been reported to support astrovirus replication 16, 17 . Replication was confirmed by an 1200-2100 fold difference in relative luciferase activity between wt and an RdRp knockout mutant (GDD â GNN) at 9 and 12 hours post transfection (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). The mutations introduced to knock out ORFX had minor effect on luciferase activity when 2A-RLuc was fused in the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). Consistent with our Ribo-Seq results (Fig.   2C ), luciferase activity for the ORFX reading frame was 14% (BSR cells; Fig. 4C ) and 21% (Huh7.5.1 cells; Fig. S12A ) of luciferase activity for the ORF2 reading frame. Thus, ORFX is efficiently translated but has only a minor (if any) direct effect on viral RNA replication.As expected, both XP knockout mutations resulted in a substantial drop in ORFX-frame luciferase activity (Fig. 4D, Fig. S12B ). This drop was more pronounced for the PTC mutant (5.5Â±0.7% wt in BSR cells and 4.1Â±1.7% in Huh7.5.1 cells) than for the AUGm mutant (AUG to ACG; 17.9Â±0.1% wt in BSR cells and 13.2Â±0.3% in Huh7.5.1 cells). ACG codons are known to permit initiation when in a strong initiation context (e.g. A at â3 and G at +4 as in the AUGm mutant) 18 . Since we wished to only use mutations that were synonymous in ORF2, we were unable to mutate the ORFX AUG codon in any other way. When utilized as an initiation codon, ACG is expected to be decoded as methionine by initiator Met-tRNA. Therefore the AUGm mutant is still expected to produce wt XP, albeit at a greatly reduced level. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe astrovirus subgenomic promoter is also situated within this region of the astrovirus genome ( Fig. 4A ). Although effective replication occurred even in the absence of XP translation (Fig.   4C ), the introduced mutations could still have a potential effect on sgRNA production via alteration of RNA structure and/or other interactions. To map the minimal region required for wt levels of sgRNA production in the context of the pO2RL replicon, we gradually truncated the sequence between the start of ORF2 and ORFX. Surprisingly, we found that a replicon containing only the first 4 or 28 nucleotides of ORF2 has very poor subgenomic reporter activity (0.6Â±0.03 and 12.5Â±0.1% that of wt pO2RL, respectively). In contrast, including the first 46 nucleotides of ORF2 restored subgenomic reporter activity to 92% of wt (Fig. 4F , S12C). These data suggest that the astrovirus subgenomic promoter is significantly longer than previously reported 19 and extends into the 5â² part ORF2, but does not appear to extend into ORFX.To determine which stage of the virus replication cycle is affected in XP knock-out viruses, we quantified released virus and viral protein and RNA levels for BSR cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed full-length pAVIC1 T7 RNAs. As expected, neither RNA nor protein levels were affected in cell-derived samples (Fig. 4G ). In contrast, in media-derived samples, XP mutant titers were significantly below wt titers when analyzed by qRT-PCR (fold differences = 0.08 and 0.05, p = 0.002 and 0.003 for AUG vs wt and PTC vs wt respectively; 2-tailed t-tests with separate variances) or virus titration (Fig. 4G ). These analyses indicate the involvement of XP late in the virus replication cycle, with XP potentially acting in either virus assembly or virus release. Since previous structural studies on the HAstV CP 20 and virion 21 have not indicated the presence of any additional proteins in the compact 43-nm virion structure, the more likely role for XP is in virus release.XP localizes to plasma membrane and perinuclear membranes with an extracellular Nterminus topology.To further investigate the function of XP, we studied its intracellular localization. To make the small XP protein more stable and enable visualization in transfected cells, we fused it either Nor C-terminally with mCherry in the context of a mammalian expression vector. The diffuse cytoplasmic localization of mCherry was drastically affected in both fusions, where it was relocalized to plasma and perinuclear membranes (Fig. 5A ). This strongly suggests the presence of a membrane-interacting domain in XP, which was not predicted by TM domain prediction software ( Fig. S8 ; see Methods). Since ORFX is completely embedded within ORF2, it may have greatly decreased evolutionary flexibility, perhaps resulting in the evolution of a non-. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Some of the putative XP proteins encoded by other astroviruses do in fact have predicted TM regions (Fig. S9 ). We also confirmed membrane and nuclear association of the XP-fused mCherry proteins by subcellular fractionation of transfected HeLa cells and subsequent analysis of the fractions (Fig. 5B ). To investigate the potential topology of XP within the plasma membrane, we probed live electroporated HeLa cells with anti-mCherry antibody, fixed the cells and analyzed them by confocal microscopy. We observed punctate staining across the plasma membrane when mCherry was fused to the N-terminus but not when it was fused to the C-terminus, suggesting an extracellular N-terminal topology and potential multimerization ( Fig. 5C-D) .XPs from HAstV1 and related astroviruses have a viroporin-like activity.Given the above results, we hypothesized a possible viroporin function for XP. Viroporins are virus-encoded ion channel proteins which disturb membrane integrity leading to permeabilization. Given the C-terminal below-threshold TM predictions for HAstV XPs (Fig.   S8 ), we hypothesized that the C-terminal region might harbour a TM pore-forming domain.Additional support came from Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles (Fig. 6B ) and a Cterminal Î±-helical structure prediction for HAstV1-8 XPs (Fig. S14) . A helical wheel representation of this region revealed a penta-leucine hydrophobic face in HAstV1 (Fig. 6A ).Although these leucines are not entirely conserved between the eight HAstV serotypes (Fig.   1F ), each XP was still predicted to contain an amphipathic Î±-helix in this region 22 . To test for viroporin-like activity, we utilized a previously described Sindbis virus replicon (SINV repC) 23 to overexpress XP or control proteins in mammalian cells. This replicon has been demonstrated to be an extremely useful tool for investigating viroporins from different RNA viruses via induced permeabilization of the plasma membrane in BHK cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B (HB). BSR cells (a clone of BHK cells) were electroporated with in vitro transcribed SINV repC RNAs, and new protein synthesis was labelled with Lazidohomoalanine (AHA) in the presence or absence of HB, followed by lysis and click chemistry-based on-gel detection 24 . Expression of XP or Strep-tagged enterovirus 2B (a wellcharacterized viroporin 25 ) led to almost total inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 6C-D) indicating that both proteins induced pronounced cell permeabilization to HB.Another widely used assay to assess the ability of proteins to permeabilize cellular membranes is based on impaired growth of Escherichia coli upon induced overexpression of a membranepermeabilizing protein 26, 27 . Consistent with the results observed in the mammalian system, . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

There are two features that are generally associated with viroporin membrane permeabilizing activity: (i) an amphipathic Î±-helix that facilitates oligomerization to form the TM pore, and (ii) adjacent positively charged residues that anchor the viroporin in the membrane 27, 28 . To test for these features in XP, two conserved RR motifs present in all eight HAstV serotypes (Fig. 1F ) were mutated to alanines (Fig. 6F) . Interestingly, only the mutation of the very C-terminal arginines resulted in loss of XP activity in this system (Fig.   6G ). Mutation of the hydrophobic leucine stretch (L95, L98, L102, L105 and L109, Fig. 6A ) to serines and threonines (Fig. 6F ) also resulted in complete loss of XP activity (Fig. 6G) . Thus, the C-terminal domain of XP is involved in membrane permeabilization and harbours key features of a viroporin.To investigate conservation of XP activity across different astrovirus species, we tested several other astrovirus XPs in the bacterial lysis assay. We used XPs from closely related HAstV4, feline (FAstV; genotype Ia), canine (CAstV; genotype Ib) and distantly related porcine (PAstV4; genotype IIIc) astroviruses in this experiment (Fig. 6H ). Protein expression constructs were created to express XPs with N-or C-terminal Strep tags, and combinations resulting in detectable protein were chosen for the assay. Induction of each of the four XPs resulted in strong inhibition of bacterial growth (Fig. 6I) , with XP expression confirmed by western blot (Fig. 6J ).Similar to HAstV XPs, all tested proteins contain one or two predicted amphipathic Î±-helices ( Fig. S15) . Thus, these findings indicate that this newly identified astrovirus protein has a membrane-permeabilizing function.The data presented here demonstrate the existence of an additional protein, XP, encoded within the human astrovirus genome. XP is important for virus growth, localizes to the plasma membrane, and plays a role in virus release. Viroporins have been reported for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and -although they can play roles in virus entry and modulation of cellular pathways -most often they facilitate virus assembly or release 26 . However, no viroporin candidate had been previously predicted for astroviruses. Identifying a viroporin is challenging due to the lack of homology among viroporins from different viruses. Viroporins are typically small hydrophobic integral membrane proteins of around 100 aa in size, with two motifs -an amphipathic Î±-helix and an adjacent cluster of positively charged residues; mutation of these residues generally abolishes viroporin activity 27 . Using two different assays and . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint computational approaches, we show that XP fulfils these criteria. XP is capable of permeabilizing cellular membranes and has a distinct N-terminal extracellular topology with one TM domain, thus making XP a candidate class IA viroporin, a class which also includes the influenza A virus M2, coronavirus E and HIV-1 Vpu proteins 26, 28 . Future work will be needed to confirm potential ion channel activity, and characterize ion specificity, structural organisation, and processes affected by XP expression in the context of viral infection. The localization of XP not only at the plasma membrane but also in the perinuclear region raises the possibility that XP may also have additional functions. Whereas the C-terminal Î±-helix appears to be associated with the cell-permeabilizing activity, additional functions (if any) of the extended N-terminal domain of XP remain to be studied.Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the presence of a protein-coding ORF overlapping ORF2 is widespread in mammalian astroviruses. It appears to be almost ubiquitous in genogroups I, III and IV and is probably present in the single genogroup V sequence. It also appears to be present in various unassigned sequences and clades. ORFX frequently has a hydrophobic stretch that is often predicted to be a TM domain and in other cases may represent a non-canonical TM domain refractory to detection with standard TM-predicting software (as appears to be the case for HAstV1). While normally absent from genogroup II astroviruses, an ORFX appears to be present in one clade (herein referred to as IId), whereas in the clade referred to herein as IIc we predicted an ORFY in the â1 instead of +1 frame, and accessed via ribosomal frameshifting instead of leaky scanning. Given the sporadic appearance of an overlapping ORF across the genogroup II phylogeny, it seems likely that the genogroup II ORFX and ORFY evolved independently from ORFX in genogroups I, III and IV, and may also therefore have different functions. In contrast, these other ORFXs may or may not have a common ancestor and/or common function (it is unclear to what extent genogroups I, III and IV form a monophyletic group; Fig. S1, Fig. S2 ). The N-terminal ~70 aa of CP are dispensable for particle assembly and likely structurally disordered 20 and may therefore be evolutionarily fairly flexible. Thus, this region of ORF2 may be unusually tolerant to the coding constraints imposed by overlapping genes. Together with the high translation level of sgRNAs at later timepoints ( Fig. 2A) , and the ease with which 5â² proximal ORFs can be expressed (requiring only leaky scanning rather than more complex expression mechanisms such as internal ribosome entry or ribosomal frameshifting 10 ), the 5â² region of the sgRNA may be particularly well-suited to the evolution of an overlapping gene, consistent with multiple independent origins of ORFXs.During this study we also developed and characterized the first astrovirus replicon system. This will be of broad utility to the astrovirus research community. Astroviruses are one of the major . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Nonetheless, despite their ubiquity and importance, astroviruses represent some of the least well-studied human viruses, partly because it has been difficult to establish efficient lab systems to study them. The replicon system developed herein will now permit detailed characterization of astrovirus replication and gene expression, and facilitate research into antiviral drugs.In summary, using comparative genomic analyses we predicted a new gene in the Mamastrovirus genus; using ribosome profiling we demonstrated XP expression in HAstV1infected cells; and using a range of techniques we demonstrated the crucial role of XP in virus growth by promoting virus release, which is likely associated with its membranepermeabilizing activity. These findings add a new dimension to astrovirus molecular biology, with potential impacts for new therapeutics (e.g. compounds that block XP activity) and vaccine development (e.g. by inhibiting XP expression).Mammalian astrovirus nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on 26 July 2018. Patent sequence records and sequences with â¥20 ambiguous nucleotide codes (e.g. \"N\"s) were removed. For the full-genome analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 were retained, giving 221 sequences (listed in Fig. S1 ). For the ORF2 analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF2 were retained, giving 415 sequences (listed in Supplementary Dataset 1) . To identify the correct 5â² end of ORF1b, we identified the AAAAAAC frameshift site. To identify the correct initiation site of ORF2, we identified the highly conserved sgRNA promoter nucleotides 29 and selected the next ORF2-frame AUG codon as the ORF2 start site in representative reference sequences; for the other sequences, the ORF2 start site was identified by amino acid alignment to one of the reference sequences. ORF1b and ORF2 sequences were extracted, translated to amino acid sequences, aligned with MUSCLE 30 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint acid rate matrices, with 1,000,000 (221-sequence trees; Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 ) or 5,000,000 (415sequence tree; Fig. S4 ) generations, discarding the first 25% as burn-in (other parameters were left at defaults). Trees were visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).The 221-sequence ORF1b tree was used to manually select clades (Fig. 1B) for full-genome SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S3) . For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S5) , we used a more objective method to select clades. Through an iterative procedure of clustering the 415 ORF2 sequences based on amino acid identity to a set of reference sequences, and selecting sequences distal from all reference sequences as new reference sequences, we arrived at a set identity to a reference, and only 20 have <55% identity; 82 and 4 sequences have >50% and >55% identity, respectively, to >1 references. Each non-reference sequence was then clustered with the reference sequence to which it has highest CP amino acid identity. This resulted in 16 singleton clusters and 26 multi-sequence clusters.Synonymous site conservation was analyzed with SYNPLOT2 9 . For the full-genome analyses we generated codon-respecting alignments using a procedure described previously 9 . In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 32 . Genomes were then mapped to reference sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined to give the multiple sequence alignment. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 coding regions were extracted from the alignment (with codons selected from the longer ORF in each overlap region), concatenated inframe, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 using a 25-codon sliding window.Conservation statistics were then mapped back to reference genome coordinates for plotting.For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses, any duplicate sequences were removed and the remaining ORF2 sequences in each clade were translated, aligned using MUSCLE as amino acid sequences, back-translated to codon-respecting nucleotide alignments, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 as above. In contrast to the full-genome alignments, all alignment gaps were retained instead of mapping to a specific reference sequence coordinate system.

TM domains were predicted with Phobius (EMBL-EBI) 34 . The XP proteins of HAstVs 1-8 were additionally queried with TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; weak TM prediction for HAstV3, no TM predicted for other HAstVs) and SOSUI (http://harrier.nagahama-ibio.ac.jp/sosui/sosui_submit.html; no TMs predicted). XP secondary structures were predicted with RaptorX 35 . To search for potential homologues of XP, XPs from Fig. S6D, Fig. S7 and The infectious clone of HAstV1 (pAVIC1, GenBank accession number L23513.1) was described previously 16 . The reverse genetics procedure was compiled from several previously published approaches 16, 17 . Initial virus was recovered from T7 transcribed RNA using reverse transfection of Huh7.5.1 cells by LipofectamineÂ® 2000 (Invitrogen) (for virus rescue, see Fig. 3) or electroporation of BSR cells in PBS at 800 V and 25 ÂµF using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell TM electroporation system (see Fig. 4 for an analysis of virus RNA in cells versus released particles). For virus passaging, the collected supernatant was treated with 10 Âµg/ml trypsin (Type IX, Sigma, #T0303) for 30 min at 37 Â°C, diluted 5 times with serum-free media, and used for infection of Caco2 cells. After 3 h of incubation, the virus containing media was replaced with serum free media containing 0.6 Âµg/ml trypsin, and cells were incubated for 48-72 h until appearance of CPE. After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, the viral stocks were aliquoted, frozen and stored at â70 Â°C. Viral stocks were titrated as previously described 35 , but using infrared detection readout, combined with automated LI-COR software-based quantification. For mammalian expression of XP, the coding sequence of mCherry alone or HAstV1 XP fused to mCherry at either the N-or C-terminus was inserted into vector pCAG-PM 36 using AflII and PacI restriction sites. The resulting constructs -designated pCAG-mCherry, pCAG-XP-mCherry, and pCAG-mCherry-XP -were confirmed by sequencing.All virus genome mutations (Fig. S11) were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis of pAVIC1 and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. To create the HAstV1 replicon system, the pAVIC1 infectious clone was left intact up to the end of ORFX, then followed by a foot and mouth disease virus 2A sequence and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) sequence fused in either the ORF2 (pO2RL) or ORFX (pXRL) reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig.   4A ). All mutations were introduced from the corresponding pAVIC1 mutants using available restriction sites and all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. Each XP coding sequence was inserted into the pOPT plasmid with a C-or N-terminal Streptag as indicated (Fig. 6I) .

The cells were Ribo-Seq analysis was performed as described previously 14 . Adaptor sequences were trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit) and trimmed reads shorter than 25 nt were discarded. Reads were mapped to host (Homo sapiens) and virus RNA using bowtie version 1 39 , with parameters -v 2 --best (i.e. maximum 2 mismatches, report best match).Mapping was performed in the following order: host rRNA, virus RNA, host RefSeq mRNA, host non-coding RNA, host genome.To normalize for library size, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator. A +12 nt offset was applied to the RPF 5â² end positions to give the approximate ribosomal P-site positions. To calculate the phasing and length distributions of host and virus RPFs, only RPFs whose 5â² end (+12 nt offset) mapped between the 13th nucleotide from the beginning and the 18th nucleotide from the end of coding sequences (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 for HAstV;RefSeq mRNAs for host) were counted, thus avoiding RPFs near initiation and termination sites. For Fig. S10 , the dual-coding region where ORFX overlaps ORF2 was also excluded.Histograms of host RPF positions (5â² end +12 nt offset) relative to initiation and termination sites were derived from RPFs mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated coding regions â¥450 nt in length and with annotated 5â² and 3â² UTRs â¥60 nt in length. Virus ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 ribosome densities (used herein as a proxy for translation levels) were calculated by counting RPFs whose 5â² end (+12 nt offset) mapped within the regions 101-2782, 2866-4311 .

At 48 hpe media samples were collected and centrifuged at 9,600 g for 5 min. The released virus samples were titrated on Caco2 cells as described above. For RT-qPCR analysis, a 150 Âµl aliquot of each sample was mixed with 4 Ã 10 6 Lysates from the above mentioned assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using standard 12% SDS-PAGE to resolve mCherry and its XP-fusion variants, and precast Novexâ¢ 10-20% tricine protein gels (Thermo Fisher) to resolve XPs and enterovirus 2B. Proteins were then transferred to 0.2 Âµm nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 4% Marvel milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Immunoblotting of mCherry was performed using anti-mCherry antibody (Abcam, ab167453). A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against XP peptide SNSGNRVSQDQNLQ (GenScript; only able to detect strongly overexpressed XP) and an anti-Strep mouse antibody (Abcam, ab184224) were used for detecting HAstV1 XP and Strep-tagged proteins, respectively. The following antibodies were used for cellular targets:anti-tubulin (Abcam, ab15568), anti-VDAC1 (Abcam, ab14734), and anti-LAMIN A+C (Abcam, ab133256).

This was performed by PCR mutagenesis using primers C0 SpeI, and FMDV 1331- In vitro transcription. 143 In vitro transcription reactions for replicon assays were performed as described previously (28).Transcription reactions to produce large amounts of RNA for SHAPE analysis were performed 145 with purified linear DNA as described above, and 1 Î¼g of linearised DNA was then used in a 146 HiScribe T7 synthesis kit (NEB), before DNase treatment and purification using a PureLink FastQ files were quality checked using FastQC with poor quality reads filtered using the 225 Sickle algorithm. Host cell reads were removed using FastQ Screen algorithm and FMDV 226 reads assembled de novo into contigs using IDBA-UD (35).

TheNMIA reactivity for the interacting nucleotides in the stem-loops with downstream residues of 302 PK 1, 2 and 3 again largely agreed with the predicted structure, although the SHAPE data 303 suggests that there might be fewer interactions than previously predicted. However, differences 304 here could be due to heterogeneity in the formation of PKs in this experiment. The evidence 305 for loop-downstream interaction was weaker for PK4.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.Changing the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5â² UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.Moreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques. In addition, these differences were more pronounced in more PKs is functionally competent as no differences was seen between replicons congaing a single 472 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).The presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.Healthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.This study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.Recent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.The Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .The ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.The reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. \n","Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and the high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced diagnostics. 15 Clinical swab samples (n = 15) were obtained from samples submitted to the Poultry Diagnostic & Research Center, University of Georgia. Detailed information about the samples is provided in Table 1 .Total RNA was extracted from each of the swab samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions, aliquoted, and stored at â80 ÂºC until further use. These samples were previously tested for IBV and GA08 serotype of IBV.Briefly, a pan IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 was used to detect IBV in general and then IBV strain specific RT-qPCR assay 36 was used to detect GA08 in the samples using the AgPath ID, One step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST following the previously described protocols.For MinION cDNA synthesis, RNA was extracted from 500 Âµl of each clinical sample using Trizol-LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer's directions.A reaction mixture of 8 Âµl of total RNA, 1 Âµl of random primers and 1 Âµl of dNTPs was incubated at 65 Â°C for 5 min, chilled on ice for at least 1 min followed by addition of 10 Âµl of cDNA synthesis mix including SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. The reaction was incubated at 25 Â°C for 10 min, then at 50 Â°C for 50 min for cDNA synthesis. The reaction was terminated at 85 Â°C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. To remove residual RNA, the cDNA solution was incubated with RNase H at 37 Â°C for 20 min. All rights reserved.

Sequencing was allowed to continue for 2 hours until 42,940 reads were obtained for Run1 and 156,000 reads were obtained for Run 2 in 6 hours.First, a lineage-typing database, containing 32 IBV S1 gene sequences (one sequence from each of 32 lineages in the 6 genotypes 44 ) and the chicken genome (GCF_000002315.4_Gallus_gallus-5.0), was constructed (referred to as \"IBV-lineage-typing database\" in this study). A second database was constructed with all the Avian Coronaviruses S1 sequences (n = 7328) available in NCBI (as of: 09-08-2017) and the chicken genome (referred to as \"All-IBV database\" in this study). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint used to assign IBV lineages to each read, as appropriate. The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.The IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score.Since some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.A schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases.Briefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input.

These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster.A minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \"top hit\" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \"sequence identity\" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \"minimum mismatches\" and \"coverage\" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as \"top hit\" in the final results.For Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) . Firstly, a primer set based on Connecticut sequence NCBI FJ904716.1 was used to amplify Genotype I-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Connecticut All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint and Massachusetts serotypes). Secondly, a primer set based on GA98 sequence NCBI AF274439.1 was used to amplify Genotype IV-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Georgia 1998 and Delaware 072 serotypes). Primer sets were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. 51 The PCR reaction mixture is composed of 10 Âµl of cDNA, 0.5 Âµl of 10 ÂµM forward primer, 0.5 Âµl of 10 ÂµM reverse primer, 2.5 Âµl of 10Ã buffer, 0.5 Âµl of enzyme mix, and 0.5 Âµl of 10mM dNTPs, then made the final volume to 25 Âµl with nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 Â°C for 1 min, followed by For Sanger sequencing data, the chromatogram from each of the samples was manually checked and primer sequences were trimmed in MEGA 6.0. 42 Forward and reverse sequences from multiple clones were aligned using MEGA 6.0 software and consensus sequences were All rights reserved.

Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) .A total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ). By using the GI-L1 primer set, which amplified Conn and Mass type IBVs, 3 of 9 IBV-positive samples were All rights reserved.

Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) .PCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940).After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters.The Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples.The number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) .Sequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample.Finally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ).

A total of 146,540 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 156,000). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 4,285 to 41,131. A total of 24,297 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 8,109 reads were discarded due to middle adapters in the basecalled reads.Real-time analysis of MinION data, which was obtained within 10 minutes of the sequencing, was sufficient for detection of IBV. However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay.

Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.The proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and Â½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.One area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.For example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.The advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.

It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] .Wuhan is central China's transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] .The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY's Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions.To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China.To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY's day, and given that LNY's day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city's lockdown.These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks..

IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China.We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city's travel ban. The LNY's day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY's day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] .Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes..

Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses.Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY's Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day.We found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan's .

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan's lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ).In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY's Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ).According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ).Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ).Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered.Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.Mobile phone-based population movement data and air passenger .

Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] .In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak's initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] .Moreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY's day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers.Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] . In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority.It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread.Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months.Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel volumes, our primary analyses assume \"business as usual\" travel based on .

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic..

The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death.Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed \"cytokine storms\" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease.Here, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS.Coronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs).To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above.For the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ).Although TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems.TWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide \"Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher\" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is \"Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination\". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 .The relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of \"Spike protein (S) of coronavirus\", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field.The distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category.We coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97).Those CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference.Several hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs. These IFITMs were significantly enriched in the local samples representing updated coronavirus-related All rights reserved.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response.Combining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\"In addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories.In this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease.For example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports.We next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections.In this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions.virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes.Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system.Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-Î³-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus.We expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data. Although histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, the right lung showed evidence of desquamation of All rights reserved.

The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps.The dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword \"coronavirus\". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword \"public health\" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses.Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG).Similar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text. Here, we used a Z score cutoff value > 6.In addition, some entities have singular and plural noun forms, and synonyms with multiple forms in the abstracts. Therefore, we numbered the subject-related entity and automatically combined nouns with plural forms and homologous words with adjectives and adverb roots into the same entity, and then assigned them the same number.

HumanImmunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the best-represented virus with 240 VIPs, with 19 nine other viruses having at least 50 VIPs (Table S1 ).Because we want to understand how adaptation to viruses proceeded, we then select 19 proteins with i) at least one available tertiary structure, ii) amino acid level resolution of 20 the interaction with one or more viruses, and iii) host tropism.This dataset represents the largest, most up-to-date set of VIPs backed up by individual 21 low-throughput publications. Nonetheless, given that many VIPs were discovered only (Methods and Table S4 ). These 241 immune VIPs include the VIPs 2 classified as antiviral (Table S4 ) throughout this manuscript. In total, 162 overlapping GO 3 cellular and supracellular processes have more than 50 VIPs (Table S3) . These 4 observations confirm that viruses interact with proteins involved in the majority of basic 5 cellular processes. To disentangle whether the slower evolution of VIPs is due to stronger purifying 14 selection or to a lower rate of adaptation, we use the ratio of non-synonymous 15 polymorphisms to synonymous polymorphisms pN/pS rather than the dN/dS ratio. Unlike 16 dN/dS that is strongly influenced by both the effects of purifying selection and 17 adaptation, pN/pS is primarily determined by the efficiency of purifying selection in 18 removing deleterious non-synonymous mutations..

Specifically, 1 we measure pN/pS as the average across non-human great apes (or as the average in 2 the 1,000 Genomes African populations; Supplemental Methods) using the data from the 3 largest chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan populations in order to further limit the noise In line with this, VIPs also show an excess of low frequency (â¤10%) deleterious non-12 synonymous variants compared to non-VIPs ( Figure S3 ). In great apes, the average The product of P-values is a good measure of whether a specific protein experienced We created a permutation test that compares VIPs and non-VIPs with the same amount 12 of purifying selection. This is achieved by using the pN/pS ratio as a proxy for purifying 14 Retrieving of ANPEP mammalian coding sequences 15 We analyzed patterns of adaptation in ANPEP in a tree of mammals including 84 16 species. These species are the ones with annotated, known or predicted mRNAs ( Table   17 S11 for their Genbank identifiers). The coding sequences were extracted from the 18 mRNAs and aligned with PRANK.The higher level of purifying selection in VIPs might be due to the fact that VIPs 22 participate in the more constrained host functions, or, alternatively, because within each 23 specific host function, viruses tend to interact with the more constrained proteins. In 24 order to assess these two non-mutually exclusive scenarios we generated 10 4 control 25 sets of non-VIPs chosen to be in the same 162 Gene Ontology processes as VIPs (GO 26 processes with more than 50 VIPs; Table S3 and Methods).The high Î± in VIPs is not explained by higher rates of adaptation in the host GO 22 processes where VIPs are well represented ( Figure S4 and Methods). Furthermore, the 23 large difference in Î± observed between VIPs and non-VIPs is robust to a number of 24 potentially confounding factors such as recombination, GC content or gene length (Table   25 S9 and Supplemental Methods). The lower pN/pS in VIPs does not explain their higher Î± 26 either (Table S9 ).The most positively selected non-antiviral VIP that fulfills all these requirements is Figure 4D ). The consensus was regained only two times after loss 28 ( Figure 4D ). This means that the signals of adaptation detected at the first and third In great apes, GO-matched non-VIPs still have a much higher pN/pS ratio compared to 28 VIPs, suggesting that VIPs tend to be more conserved than non-VIPs from the same GO The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 permutation test P=0 after 10 9 iterations). The stronger purifying selection acting on VIPs 1 is apparent within most functions. Figure 1C shows stronger purifying selection in the 20 2 high level GO categories with the most VIPs. In all the 20 GO categories pN/pS is lower 3 in VIPs than in non-VIPs, and the difference is significant for 17 of these categories 4 (Table S3 ). This shows that within a wide range of host functions, viruses tend to target 5 the most conserved proteins.We further use the classic MK test (excluding variants below 10%) to investigate the 28 excess of adaptation for the specific VIPs of ten human viruses and in the 20 high level 29 GO categories with the most VIPs ( Figure 1E and F). We do not use the asymptotic MK Pleiotropy is more likely in proteins with many functions (He and Zhang, 2006), and the 28 subset of VIPs with many annotated GO processes has an excess of adaptation that is 29 very similar to the one observed when using all VIPs ( Figure S8B ). Adaptation to viruses 30 could thus have affected the evolution of host phenotypes in unexpected ways. In this 31 respect, it is particularly intriguing that VIPs have experienced highly increased rates of 32 adaptation within host functions such as development or neurogenesis (Table S3) .Interestingly, even immune VIPs (Table S4 ) have a significantly reduced pN/pS ratio 7 compared to immune non-VIPs ( Figure 1C ), which suggests that immune proteins in 8 direct contact with viruses are more constrained. The reduction in pN/pS in non-immune 9 VIPs (no antiviral or any other immune function, Table S4 ) is very similar to the reduction 10 observed in the entire set of VIPs ( Figure 1C ). Table S3 Table S5 ). Since VIPs are more 23 constrained than non-VIPs and tend to have more non-synonymous deleterious low 24 frequency variants than non-VIPs (Figures 1 and S3 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7The classic MK test is known to be biased downward by the presence of slightly 1 deleterious non-synonymous variants and this bias is difficult to eliminate fully even by 2 excluding low frequency variants (Messer and Petrov, 2013) . Note that our application 3 of the classic MK test to discover the higher rate of adaptation in VIPs compared to non-4 VIPs is conservative given that the VIPs have a higher proportion of slightly deleterious We therefore apply an asymptotic modification of the MK test known to provide 10 estimates of Î± without a downward bias in the presence of slightly deleterious variants 11 (Messer and Petrov, 2013) . To further validate the asymptotic MK test we carry out 12 extensive population simulations (Messer, 2013) to show that this test is indeed robust to 13 a number of potential biases (Supplemental Methods and Table S8 ).14 Using the asymptotic MK test we estimate that in VIPs, ~27% of the 1,897 amino acid 15 substitutions along the human lineage were adaptive ( Figure 1D ). This proportion is 16 three times higher than the estimated proportion of ~9% in non-VIPs ( Figure 1D ). Thus,although VIPs represent only 13% of the orthologs in our dataset, we estimate that in 18 human evolution they account for almost 30% of all adaptive amino-acid changes. Note Although we already find a strong signal of increased adaptation, the amount of adaptive 18 evolution that can be attributed to viruses is probably underestimated by our analysis.Finally and importantly, the 80% of VIPs with no known antiviral or broader immune 6 function (Table S4 ) have a strongly increased rate of adaptation according to both the 7 classic MK test (Î±=0.26 in VIPs versus -0.02 in non-VIPs, permutation test P=3x10 -7 ; 8 Figure 1F ) and the asymptotic MK test, with the latter estimating Î±=38% in non-immune 9 VIPs against only 11% for non-immune non-VIPs. Intriguingly, unlike for non-immune 10 VIPs or all VIPs considered together (top of Figure 1F ), immune VIPs, including antiviral 11 VIPs (Table S4) , do not show any increase of adaptation compared to immune non-VIPs. We speculate that this pattern might reflect the masking effect of balancing The increased rate of adaptation in VIPs in the human lineage strongly suggests that 20 VIPs in our dataset, 95% of which interact with modern viruses (Table S1 ), were also 21 VIPs during past human evolution. It is also plausible that a substantial proportion of the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

For a specific coding sequence, the 2 BS-REL test estimates the proportion of codons where the rate of non-synonymous 3 substitutions is higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS>1), which is a 4 hallmark of adaptive evolution. The BS-REL test then compares two competing models 5 of evolution, one with adaptive substitutions and one without adaptive substitutions, and 6 decides which of the two models is the best fit. For each branch of the tree, the BS-REL 7 test provides a P-value that corresponds to the probability that no adaptation occurred in 8 the branch. The product of P-values across all branches in the tree then gives the 9 probability that no adaptation occurred anywhere along the entire tree (Supplemental 10 Methods).The purifying selection-wise permutation test shows that adaptation has been much 29 more common in VIPs than in non-VIPs across mammals (Figure 2 ). We estimate thatVIPs have experienced 77% more adaptation compared to non-VIPs (Figure 2A) . In 31 total, this represents ~76,000 more adaptive amino acid changes in VIPs compared to 32 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint non-VIPs. We further use an increasingly strict level of evidence for the presence of 1 adaptation, by including only proteins with increasingly low products of P-values; that is, 2 increasingly low probability that no adaptation occurred (Figure 2A ). Figure GO processes with a strong excess of adaptation include cellular processes such as 17 transcription, signal transduction, apoptosis, or post-translational protein modification, 18 but also supracellular processes related to development ( Figure 2C and Table S3 ).Since 95% of the VIPs were discovered for viruses infecting humans, it is possible that 24 the observed excess of adaptation in VIPs in mammals is due to higher rates of 25 adaptation exclusively in the primate branches of the mammalian tree ( Figure S1 ).However, all mammalian clades in the tree show a similar excess of adaptation in VIPs 27 ( Figure 2D ). Primates stand out due to their low overall proportions of positively selected 28 codons compared to the other mammalian clades in the tree ( Figure 2D ).

This phylogenetically widespread excess of adaptation 3 implies that many of the VIPs annotated in humans were also VIPs for a substantial To identify a new non-antiviral protein we first exclude all VIPs with a well-known 16 antiviral activity (Table S4 ) and then select all remaining VIPs with strong overall 17 evidence of adaptation (Table S10 ) and at least 10 branches with signals of adaptation.We identified 1,256 VIPs out of a total of 9,861 proteins with orthologs in the genomes of 16 the 24 mammals included in the analysis ( Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2). Annotation Interestingly, VIPs tend to be multifunctional proteins. Indeed they represent 13% of all 25 the orthologs in the analysis, 33% of the orthologs with 60 or more annotated GO 26 processes, and 40% of orthologs with 100 or more GO processes ( Figure S8A )..

All: entire tree. Primata:\n","they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.Children represent an epidemiological group of central importance for the transmission of influenza [76, 95, 5] . They often have a larger vulnerability to infections because of limited prior immunity, and they mix at school with high contact rates [80] thus representing key drivers for influenza spread. The closure of school has been associated to the potential of reducing influenza propagation in the community by breaking important chains of transmission. It is expected to potentially delay the peak, and reduce the epidemic impact, at peak time and of the overall wave. Though not specifically recommended by the World Health Organization during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is envisioned as a possible non-pharmaceutical intervention for pandemic mitigation left to the decision of national and local authorities [12, 98] .A large body of literature exists on the topic, however contrasting evidence lead to no definitive emerging consensus [22, 69] . Benefits and limita-tions appear to depend on the specific epidemic context. For example, influenza epidemics characterized by a larger attack rate in children compared to adults are expected to be more sensitive to the closure of schools [24] . This experience was reported in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where closed schools coincided with a marked reduction of influenza activity [71, 82, 25, 64, 99, 28, 29, 79, 42, 43, 4, 33, 65] . School closure interventions are often considered along with other mitigation strategies, as it happened with social distancing in Mexico following the pandemic outbreak [35, 28] , making their effect more difficult to isolate. Studies generally report a slowing down effect in the incidence during closure, however in some cases the effect may be mixed with the natural decline of the epidemic, because of late implementation [69] . In addition, no clear trend is observed in the impact of school closure on the epidemic burden depending on the time of closure -before, around, or after the peak [69] .Given its potentially important role in reducing the epidemic impact, school closure has more often been investigated in the realm of pandemics compared to seasonal influenza [69] . For the latter, regular school closure during holidays in temperate regions has been considered as a natural example to evaluate the impact of school closure [62, 23, 52] . Directly extending the application to pandemic situations has however important limitations. Closure associated to winter holidays is regularly scheduled in the school calendar, whereas school closure as an intervention corresponds to an unplanned interruption of school attendance that may take different forms (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, at the national or local level, with a gradual closure of classes or of the entire school) [22, 53, 49, 30] . In addition to the different nature of closure, also its duration changes from a fixed scheduled period of holidays to one of variable extension depending on the ongoing epidemic and resulting outcome. How individual behavior changes in all these conditions is the critical aspect to quantify in order to accurately assess the impact of school closure on transmission.Transmission models fitting the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or parameterized to a similar pandemic scenario have been used to assess the value of school closure or summer holidays [79, 39, 4, 49, 30] . Few of them are based on estimates for social mixing changes [39, 4] , as data collected during a pandemic are limited [68, 39] , leaving other approaches to rely on assumptions about contacts that may critically affect the studies' findings. Applications to seasonal influenza may on the other hand count on a more accurate description of population mixing. Surveys conducted over the calendar year to measure variations of mixing patterns [61, 41, 40, 13] offer indeed the opportunity to perform data-driven modeling studies that mechanistically assess the role of school holidays on seasonal influenza. Interestingly, they also highlighted considerably large differences across countries in the way contacts change from term-time to school holidays [61] , suggesting the need for country-specific estimates to accurately and reliably parameterize models.Changes in mobility is another important aspect that is rarely integrated in school closure studies. Travel is known to be responsible for the spatial dissemination of influenza [57, 94, 32, 46, 44, 47, 9, 10, 7, 4] . In addition to extraordinary travel drops in reaction to epidemics [2, 7, 84] , mobility changes regularly occur during school holidays compared to term-time [75, 45] . Moreover, important differences were highlighted in the mobility of children vs. adults and their associated variations, so that their coupling with social mixing changes occurring during holidays may have a considerable impact on the epidemic outcome [4, 45] .Our aim is to explicitly integrate social mixing and travel from data into a modeling framework to assess how variations induced by regular school closure may impact seasonal influenza epidemics. Three modeling studies were developed so far with similar objectives. Towers and Chowell studied the impact of day-of-week variations in human social contact patterns on incidence data collected at a large hospital in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 H1N1pdm [90] . Their approach was not spatial, therefore did not consider mobility changes, and mainly focused on the sensitivity of influenza incidence variations to the latency period. Apolloni et al. used a stylized analytical approach to evaluate the role of age-dependent social mixing and travel behavior on the conditions for epidemic spatial invasion [4] . The model can compare different contexts, with or without schools in terms, and also account for associated changes. The contexts are however considered independently (no full school calendar can be considered) and the epidemic impact is evaluated only in terms of conditions for spatial dissemination. Going beyond these limitations, more recently Ewing et al. introduced an age-specific spatial metapopulation model to evaluate how behavioral changes associated to winter holiday impact the flu season [45] . The model is applied to the United States and it integrates data on travel behavior, whereas mixing is assumed from estimates available from Europe and adapted to summer holiday changes measured in the UK during the 2009 pandemic [39] . Their findings identify changes in mixing patterns as the key element responsible for the epidemic effects induced by holidays.Given the central role of mixing patterns largely supported by evidence [22, 69, 4, 45] , the heterogeneous country-specific contact variations measured in Europe [80, 61] , and the marked difference expected in individual behavior during a seasonal flu epidemic vs. a pandemic, here we extend prior approaches to introduce a data-driven spatially explicit model fully parameterized on Belgium. The aim is to reduce assumptions in favor of input data, and to exclusively focus on seasonal influenza and associated parameterization. Contact data associated to four types of calendar days are considered, belonging to Regular Weekday, Regular Weekend, Holiday Weekday, Holiday Weekend (here 'regular' refers to non-holiday period), allowing us to assess the role of weekends in addition to holidays. A richer calendar with additional holidays beyond Christmas break is also considered. Confirming and extending prior results with a different modeling approach and input data would greatly support our understanding of the role of changes in mixing and travel on influenza epidemics.In order to study the role of changes in contact patterns and in travel behavior along the calendar, we considered a mathematical approach for the spatial transmission of influenza in Belgium. We built a discrete stochastic age-specific spatial metapopulation model at the municipality level, based on demographic, mixing, and mobility data of Belgium. We parameterized it with influenza-like-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health at the district level for the 2008/2009 season. By using the Belgian school calendar for that season, we assessed the impact of the individual changes in mixing and travel behavior during regular school closure, given by available data. We then tested experimental scenarios to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed epidemic outcomes. Here, we describe in detail the mathematical model, input data, calibration procedure and experimental scenarios.nected through a coupling process generally describing hosts mobility. Here we consider the population to be divided into two age classes, children and adults, based on the modeling framework introduced by Apolloni et al. [4] . Infection dynamics occur inside each patch, driven by the contacts between and within these two classes, and spatial spread occurs via the mobility of individuals ( Figure 1 ). Both processes are modeled explicitly with a discrete and stochastic approach. The model is based on Belgian data and follows the time evolution of the 2008/2009 school calendar. It includes 589 patches corresponding to the 589 municipalities (nl. gemeenten, fr. communes) of Belgium. Weekends and school holidays are explicitly considered, and variations in mixing and travel behavior are accounted for in the model and based on data. In the following, we describe in detail the various components of the model.Individuals are divided into children (c, age less than 19y) and adults (a, otherwise). Population size and age structure per municipality as of January 1, 2008 are obtained from Belgian Statistics [1] .Social mixing between the two age groups is quantified by contact matrices extracted from the data obtained through a Belgian social contact survey [80, 61] :where the element ij (i = a, c, j = a, c) is given by:with M ij the average number of contacts made by survey participants in age class i with individuals in age class j, N j the population of age class j, N tot the total population of Belgium. C C C is defined at the national level, and here we assume that it is the same throughout the country, with the number of contacts being altered exclusively by the patch demography. From survey data, we have that the contact matrix for a regular weekday is:C reg weekday C reg weekday C reg weekday = C cc C ca C ac C aa = 40.71 7.84 7.84 14.25 .(The variations for the other day types are discussed in paragraph 2.1.4.All rights reserved.

Figure 1 : Schematic illustration of the spatial age-structured metapopulation model. The metapopulation modeling scheme is composed of three layers. At the country scale, Belgium is modeled as a set of patches (here indicated with q and p) corresponding to municipalities coupled through mobility of individuals f pq (i) of age class i at time t. Within each municipality, population is divided into two age classes, children (c) and adults (a), whose mixing pattern is defined by the contact matrix C C C. Individuals resident of patch p and individuals commuting to that patch (e.g. resident of patch q) mix together following commuting. The figure reports as an example the contact matrix of a regular weekday (Eq. (3)). Mobility and mixing vary based on the calendar day (regular/holiday, weekday/weekend). Influenza disease progression at the individual level is modeled through a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered compartmental scheme, with Î² indicating the per-contact transmission rate, the rate from exposed to infectious state, Âµ the recovery rate.Influenza disease progression is described through a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model ( Figure 1 ) [3, 74] . A susceptible individual can contract the disease with a per-contact transmissibility rate Î² from infectious individuals, then entering the exposed or latent class. After an average latency period of â1 = 1.1 days [15, 20] , the individual becomes infectious for an average duration Âµ â1 = 3 days [15, 20] and can transmit the infection, before recovering and becoming immune to the disease. A fraction of children (g c ) and adults (g a ) were considered immune to the disease at the beginning of the influenza epidemic, based on available knowledge on prior immunity and vaccination coverage in the country for the 2008/2009 influenza season and prior seasons (g c = 39.87%, g a = 53.19%) [100, 72, 89] .The force of infection for a susceptible individual of age class i (i = a, c) in a given patch p is given by:where j runs on age classes, I p j (t) and N p (t) count the total number of infectious individuals of age class j and the total population size of patch p at time t, respectively. This quantity changes with time for two reasons. The first is the school calendar, distinguishing between regular weekdays, regular weekends, holiday weekdays, holidays weekends, and accounted for by C ij (t). The second is the mobility of individuals. At a given day of the simulation, each patch p may include: non-commuting residents of p, commuters from neighboring patches for school/work, commuting residents of p after school/work (see paragraph 2.1.3).Coupling from patch p to patch q is given by the mobility of age class i, i.e. f pq (i) (Figure 1 ). We considered commuting data across patches from the 2001 Socio Economic Survey of the Belgian Census [66] to describe the regular mobility of individuals for school/work during a regular weekday. Data are not age-specific, so we extracted the commuting fluxes per age class based on the probability of children (adults) of commuting on a given distance computed on the French commuting data [67] . Such inference was based on the assumption of a similar mobility behavior across the two neighboring countries.Air travel was not considered due to negligible internal air traffic within the country.Changes in social mixing are based on the data of the Belgian social contact survey [80, 61] , where participants were asked to report their number of contacts during a regular weekday, a regular weekend, a holiday weekday or a holiday weekend. In addition to the contact matrix of Eq.(3), we have:C reg weekend C reg weekend C reg weekend = 12.51 6.00 6.00 10.85 for a regular weekend,C hol weekday C hol weekday C hol weekday = 14.02 7.28 7.28 12.29 for a holiday weekday,C hol weekdend C hol weekdend C hol weekdend = 10.89 7.20 7.20 8.59 for a holiday weekend.Concerning variations in mobility, schools are closed during weekends and holidays, so no commuting exists for children in those days. We considered adults to continue commuting during holiday weekdays, assuming that adults' time off of work would be homogeneously distributed throughout the year. Concerning adult mobility during the weekends, we estimated the travel fluxes reductions based on statistics available for France [88], based on the same assumptions explained in paragraph 2.1.3. The resulting agespecific reductions for mobility are defined in Table 1 . Time is discretized considering a time step of dt = 0.5 days, with one timestep corresponding to the activities performed during a workday (i.e. commuting, social mixing), followed by a time step corresponding to the activities performed out of that timeframe (i.e. social mixing), as typically done in agent-based epidemic models [79] . Influenza transmission within each patch is modeled with binomial processes. Starting from the initial conditions set by influenza-like-illness surveillance data, we performed 2Â·10 3 stochastic runs for each model under study.Our model was based on the official Belgian school calendar for school year 2008/2009. Classes in Belgium are in session from Monday to Friday, and schools are closed during the weekends. The calendar included the following holidays for the 2008/2009 academic year during which schools were closed:â¢ Fall holiday: from October 25 to November 2, including the public holiday of the first and second of November;â¢ Public holiday of November 11;â¢ Christmas holiday: from December 20, 2008 to January 4, 2009;â¢ Winter holiday: from February 21 to March 1;â¢ Easter holiday: from April 4 to April 17;â¢ Long weekend: from May 1 to May 3, around the public holiday of May 1;â¢ Long weekend: from May 21 to May 24, around the public holiday of May 21;â¢ Long weekend: from May 30 to June 1, around the public holiday of June 1.From July 1 to August 31 schools are closed for the summer holidays.We used influenza surveillance data collected by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health [91] . Data report new ILI episodes registered each week by the network of sentinel general practitioners (GP). ILI is defined as sudden onset of symptoms, high fever, respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat) and systemic symptoms (headache, muscular pain). For every episode, additional information is reported: age group (<5, 5-14, 15-64, 65-84, 85+), hospitalization, antiviral treatment, vaccination status, municipality of residence. The use of ILI surveillance data to approximate influenza incidence is a usual practice [81, 96, 56] and in the case of Belgium previous work showed good agreement of ILI data with virological data [16] and robustness across different surveillance systems [92] . Surveillance data on the new number of cases were aggregated at the district level to reduce signal noise.The metapopulation model was calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. Though the simulated dynamics is spatially explicit, calibration was performed on Brussels district only, i.e. by comparing the simulated incidence profile of Brussels to the incidence ILI data for that district. We did not consider calibrating the model also in the remaining districts, as these were used for validation.The model was seeded with the first non-zero incidence value provided by surveillance data per district and accounted for possible sampling biases. We used a bootstap/particle filter Weighted Least Square (W LS) with 20 particles to calibrate our model fixing the epidemiological parameters described in paragraph 2.1.2 and obtain the per-contact transmissibility Î². Calibration was performed on normalized incidence curves to discount effects due to unknown GP consultation rates.To assess the impact of variations in contacts and mobility due to school closures, we compared the realistic model based on the Belgian school calendar and integrating the changes described in paragraph 2.1.4 with a set of experimental scenarios that we describe here. 11 All rights reserved.

In addition, we tested the w/o holiday model, where all holiday periods of the calendar are removed, and only the week structure is kept. We also considered a synthetic scenario where we extended the Christmas holiday of one week, before the start of the break, or after its end, referred to as the Christmas holiday extension models.To assess the interplay between the timing of the epidemic and that of the holiday periods, we considered anticipation and delays of the start of the epidemic season, as follows:â¢ the 4 weeks anticipation model (â4w ), where the start of the simulated influenza epidemic is anticipated 4 weeks prior to the start of the realistic model calibrated on the empirical data;â¢ the 2 weeks anticipation model (â2w ), as above with an anticipation of 2 weeks;â¢ the 2 weeks delay model (+2w ), as above with a delay of 2 weeks;â¢ the 4 weeks delay model (+4w ), as above with a delay of 4 weeks.In all these cases, the start of the epidemic is the only aspect that is being altered, whereas the school calendar (and associated variations in social mixing and travel behavior) remains fixed.We analyzed the spatial distribution of the force of infection determined by the demographic profile in space. To do so, we studied the distribution of the patch reproductive number R p that can be calculated as the largest eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix [38, 97] . This is done for the four types of days considered in terms of their variations of social mixing, namely regular weekday, regular weekend, holiday weekday, and holiday weekend.Validation of the model is performed by comparing the simulated incidence profiles to the empirical surveillance data at the national and at the district level. In particular, we looked at the peak difference per district d per stochastic run r:where T d (r) is the peak time of weekly incidence of run r in district d and T d ILI is the incidence peak reported from surveillance data in the same district. Medians per patch over 2 Â· 10 3 stochastic runs are computed. Scenario analyses are performed in order to assess the difference of an experimental scenario with the realistic model. We quantified the various comparisons in terms of:â¢ the peak time difference per patch âT p = T p scenario â T p realistic model , with T p the median peak time of the incidence curve in patch p computed on all stochastic runs (for both the scenario under study and the realistic model);â¢ the peak incidence relative variation per patch âI p = (I p scenario â I p realistic model ) /I p realistic model , with I p the median incidence value at peak time in patch p;â¢ the epidemic size relative variation per patch âÏ p = (Ï p scenario â Ï p realistic model ) /Ï p realistic model , with Ï p the median epidemic size in patch p.Medians and 50%, 95% confidence intervals at the patch levels are computed for synthesis. In addition, medians, 50%, 95% confidence intervals of the simulated incidence ate also calculated at the national level across the tested scenarios.Season 2008/2009 shows an ILI incidence that reaches its peak in week 5 of 2009, both in Brussels district and at the national level. The incidence is visibly slowed down during Christmas holiday (Figure 2) , suggesting that holiday periods may have a measurable effect on transmission. The simulated peak time is found to be within one week of the empirically observed time for 76% of the districts, and within two weeks for 90% of them. Only two districts in the Province of Luxembourg showed greater discrepancies (four weeks). We observed a mild tendency towards a radial increase of the peak time difference from Brussels to the edge of the country, with 4 weeks difference obtained on the border between Belgium and Luxembourg.The average patch reproductive number is estimated to be R = 2.12, corresponding to Î² = 0.0850 ([0.0674, 0.0858] 95% confidence interval (CI)) of the per-contact transmissibility obtained from the calibration procedure (see Methods). The variation of R p at the patch level is given by the demographic profile of the population and its immunity profile. In addition, it also depends on the day type considered, whether regular or during a holiday, whether during the week or the weekend (Figure 2 ). Larger variations and higher values are obtained for a regular weekday, having the largest number of contacts, compared to less heterogeneous distributions and smaller R p values 14 All rights reserved.

The patch reproductive number is lowest for the holiday weekend, corresponding to the lowest mixing.To assess the impact that changes in the social mixing or travel behaviors of individuals have on the epidemic outcome, we tested different experimental scenarios where we independently singled out these aspects. These scenarios 15 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Changes in individual behavior induced by weekends and holidays are found to strongly alter the epidemic dynamics leading to a considerable delay of the peak time (median of 3.7 weeks across patches, regular weekday model compared to the realistic model, Figure 3b ) and smaller peak time incidence (33% median relative change, Figure 3d ) and total epidemic size (11% median relative change, Figure 3c ).Once the variations in individual behavior affecting social mixing or mobility are considered in isolation, social mixing variation during weekends and holidays is found to be mainly responsible for the effects just described. The travel changes model is indeed comparable to the regular weekday model, whereas neglecting changes in mobility (mixing changes model) produces epidemic patterns very similar to the realistic model (zero median variations).The school calendar in Belgium during the influenza season counts four long holiday periods: Fall holiday, Christmas holiday, Winter holiday, Easter holiday (see Methods). Cumulatively, all holidays concur to delay the peak time of 1.7 weeks and to reduce the epidemic size of approximately 2%, with a reduction of the peak incidence (4%, all median values across patches, Figure 4 ). Among all holiday periods, the largest effect is produced by the Christmas holiday, responsible for the overall reduction of the epidemic size and a peak delay of about 1 week. The early break of Fall holiday has negligible impact instead. Winter holiday leads to a very small reduction of the epidemic size (median of 1%), but no effect on the peak timing or peak incidence. The impact of Easter holiday is negligible on all indicators. By comparing the effect of the regular weekday model (Figure 3 ) with the one of the w/o holiday model (Figure 4) , both on the realistic model, we find that weekends have a major effect in slowing down the epidemic curve: a difference of âT p = â3.7, [â3.9, â3.6] weeks when no weekends are considered compared to âT p = â1.7, [â1.9, â1.2] weeks when they are included.Given the major role of Christmas holiday, we also tested the effect of 1-week extension, before or after the break. The extension before Christmas holidays does not impact the resulting epidemic (Figure 4 , panels d-e-f). If the additional week of holiday is considered after the break, no changes to the epidemic timing are observed, however the incidence at the peak decreases of 4% (median values), respectively.

Boxplots refer to the distributions across patches.Christmas holidays are found to be the school closure period with the highest impact on the epidemic outcome, on both its timing and burden, for the 2008/2009 influenza season. Here we assess how this result may vary depending on the timing of the season, by investigating its interplay with the school closure calendar. In order to distinguish between effects induced by the timing of the in-18 All rights reserved.

We explored anticipations and delays of this epidemic of two or four weeks and compared the results with the realistic model.The strongest impact is observed for the earliest epidemic (â4w model) reporting a median anticipation of more than one week with respect to the realistic model (once discounted for the earlier start) and a median reduction of the peak incidence of about 10% ( Figure 5 ). All other epidemics are rather similar to the realistic one, except for the â2w model reporting a considerable reduction of the peak incidence (median of approximately 13% across patches). In addition, it is important to note that, differently from previous effects, the anticipation or delay of the season leads to a considerably larger variation of the simulated epidemic indicators across patches, signaled by the larger confidence intervals reported in Fig. 5 . In this study, we considered the impact of regular school closure on the spatio-temporal spreading pattern of seasonal influenza. We focused on the case study of the 2008/2009 influenza season in Belgium. We used a spatial metapopulation model for the transmission of influenza in the country, based on data on contacts and mobility of individuals, and integrating data-driven changes in mixing and travel behavior during weekends and holiday periods. The model calibrated on a single district (i.e. a subset of patches, â¼ 3% of the country total) is able to reproduce with fairly good agreement the empirical pattern observed in the country for that season, suggesting that data-driven mixing and mobility are crucial ingredients to capture influenza spatial dynamics [94, 18, 36, 10, 79, 39, 4, 26, 45] . The result is a spatially heterogeneous propagation where the two ingredients act at different levels.Mixing is patch-dependent and determined by the local demography. The large variations observed in the distribution of children vs. adults lead to heterogeneous distributions of the values of the reproductive numbers per patch. In specific mixing conditions -e.g. those of a holiday weekenda large fraction of patches has R p 1, indicating that those locations are found to be close to the critical conditions for epidemic extinction. Influenza is mainly sustained in patches having larger R p during those periods, and epidemic activity is then transferred to other patches through the mobility of infected individuals. Three-fourth of Belgian districts reach their epidemic peak in the simulations within one week of the empirical peak time. Districts exhibiting greater delays lie on the border of the country. This may be due to the model neglecting the mobility coupling between these regions and the neighboring countries, which is considerably large in some districts (e.g. the flux of individuals of the Luxembourg province commuting abroad represents almost 40% of the total flux of commuters of the district). Our study considered the country to be isolated for the sake of simplicity. We expect this border effect to be increasingly negligible for larger countries.The simulated incidence profile clearly shows a slowing down in the growth of the number of new infections during the Christmas break, as reported by sentinel surveillance in the country, suggesting that holiday is associated to temporary reductions in influenza transmission. This was also found in previous empirical studies [23, 45] . To identify the mechanisms behind this effect, we isolated the changes in mixing and those in travel behavior during school closure, comparing different experimental scenarios, similar to Ewing 20 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/230565 doi: bioRxiv preprint et al. [45] . We found that mixing changes during weekends and holidays lead to a considerable delay of the epidemic, whereas travel changes would produce no noticeable effect. Moreover, changes in the social contacts would explain the entire difference observed between the realistic model based on the calendar and a model that does not include school closure. This confirms prior modeling findings on winter holidays for several influenza seasons in the United States [45] . In contrast to that work, we found however that an important mitigation of the epidemic impact at peak time also occurs, besides the peak delay.The strong impact of the variation of mixing behavior is easily interpretable in terms of the reduction of the transmission potential expressed by the reproductive numbers per patch. This mainly results from the reduction of the number of contacts between children, as measured by the social contact survey conducted once schools are closed [61] . Travel changes, on the other hand, do not act directly on the transmission potential but affect the coupling force between epidemics in different patches and the opportunity for individuals to be exposed to the disease. For this reason, changes in travel behavior have a smaller effect that is found to be negligible for influenza epidemic spread, as also observed in the work of [45] . This is also consistent with the large literature on travel restrictions showing the little or no effect that these interventions have on pandemic spatial spread [32, 63, 46, 31, 44, 11, 18, 7, 84] . In addition to holidays, we also found that the closure of school during weekends has a visible effect on the epidemic, periodically dampening transmission, similarly to what observed in [90] . This is generally not reported by influenza surveillance systems, as data are collected on a weekly basis.For the 2008/2009 influenza season we found that Christmas holiday, occurring during a growing phase of influenza activity, is the school break responsible for the largest impact in terms of timing (about 1 week anticipation if holiday is not observed), along with a 5% reduction of the epidemic size. If the school break occurs earlier (as for the Fall holiday) or much later in the influenza season (e.g. Easter holiday), no effect is produced on the resulting epidemic. The case of Winter holidays occurring during the fadeout of the epidemic shows that a small reduction of the total number of cases can still be achieved with school closure after the epidemic peak, whereas other studies showed minimal impact [45] .The analysis on a single season illustrates well how the epidemic impact of school closure depends on the interplay between closure timing and in-fluenza season. By systematically exploring this interplay through synthetic scenarios, we confirm the importance of Christmas holiday in mitigating the influenza epidemic. Most importantly, we found that the break would have the largest impact for a very early season when school closing would occur at or around the epidemic peak. Reduction in transmission due to fewer contacts leads to a strong reduction of the incidence and ultimately of the total epidemic size, as also observed in pandemic settings [69] . In the other synthetic influenza seasons explored, a rebound effect was obtained when schools reopened after the break, most notably for the early season anticipating of two weeks the 2008/2009 influenza epidemic (-2w model). This was previously observed in other contexts [60, 48, 17, 8, 14, 62, 6, 35] , also when no additional interventions beyond school closure were considered [48, 62] . The various tested scenarios show that Christmas break would have a larger mitigating impact if it occurs before (or around) the peak and when the incidence is about half the peak value or larger.Our investigation shows that the role of holiday timing can be hardly inferred from few examples, and that other breaks beyond Christmas [45] may have an important mitigating impact. Also, the effect of a sequence of holidays occurring in an influenza season cannot be simply derived as a sum of the effects of each holiday period considered separately. Each break indeed affects the epidemic in a different way, altering its subsequent evolution in a non-linear way, so that the full calendar needs to be considered. Our findings help shedding light on previous empirical findings showing no clear pattern for the effects of school closure on peak incidence or total epidemic size, comparing closures before and after the peak [69] .In addition to school breaks already occurring in the calendar, we also explored a possible extension of Christmas holiday of one week. We chose this break as it led to the largest epidemic impact in our case study, and also because it generally occurs before the influenza epidemic peak (this is the case for all influenza seasons from the studied season to the current one, pandemic season excluded). As such, we expect it could have a favorable impact on the epidemic outcome in the majority of influenza seasons. Previous work analyzing the length of school closure found that two weeks or more appear to be enough to result in a recognizable effect [48, 62, 23, 99, 6] , whereas shorter closures may not be beneficial or may not have an obvious impact [37, 34, 70, 86, 19] . Our synthetic results show that the extension would be advantageous only if implemented after the Christmas break, with a mitigation of the peak incidence and a minimal peak delay of a few days. Extensions are generally considered in the realm of reactive closures against a pandemic influenza.Here we decided to test this scenario as a regular closure given that -in a broader context -authorities in Belgium are currently discussing whether to modify the school calendar for pedagogical reasons: the aim would be to reduce summer holidays and redistribute holiday periods throughout the year [54] . We found that an extension of the Christmas holiday would be beneficial in the management of the influenza season potentially mitigating its epidemic impact.Our findings are obtained on seasonal influenza, and results on peak delay were also recovered by modeling works on synthetic influenza pandemics considering reactive school closure [79] . The straightforward extension of our conclusions to the pandemic case faces however several challenges. First, effects induced by school closure may be specific to the specific epidemic profile, and therefore they may lead to different results depending on the pandemic under consideration [22] . For example, beneficial effects of school closure during 2009 H1N1 pandemic may have resulted from the larger magnitude of children attack rates vs. adults. Epidemic contexts more homogeneously impacting age classes may be less affected by school closure. Second, the nature of the school closure may alter the behavior of individuals during that period. In our study we considered holidays that are regularly planned in the school calendar and associated to specific social activities (e.g. vacation trips, family visits and others), for which contact data are available [61] . School closure during an influenza pandemic may be envisioned as a proactive or reactive measure to the ongoing outbreak. Not being planned, it is expected to have a stronger disruptive impact on social mixing of individuals on the short term compared to regular closure. On the other hand, it is argued that prolonged closure may limit the reduction of contacts on the long term, because of costs and logistics, and reduction in compliance rate [23, 22] . Having shown here that changes in social mixing represent the single element critically responsible for the impact of school closure on the epidemic outcome, we note that modeling results on school closure in the case of a pandemic would strongly be affected by assumptions considered for mixing changes, in absence of data.While a large body of literature has recently focused on behavioral changes during an epidemic [51, 83, 85, 50, 93] , still little is known to quantify them [68, 39, 61, 41, 40, 101, 102, 27, 77] . Our work focused on Belgium, as a rather detailed survey was conducted in the country to estimate contact rates in the population of different age classes at different periods of the calendar year [61] . These estimates constituted the input data to parameterize our spatial modeling framework. Modeling approaches to study epidemics in settings where no data exist are often based on the assumption that mixing would reduce following school closure and import estimates available from other settings or epidemiological contexts [79, 49, 45] . This may lead to several issues. Contacts and their changes along the calendar may be country-specific [80] , thus affecting epidemic results when applied to a different context. Estimates of the overall reduction of the number of contacts during school closure vary widely. Transmission models fitted to epidemic data estimated reductions ranging from 16-18% for holidays during seasonal influenza in France [23] , to 25% in Hong Kong for proactive school closure during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [99] , to 30% for the social distancing interventions (including school closure) implemented in Mexico following the start of 2009 pandemic [28] . A large-scale population-based prospective survey in Europe estimated the changes in contact patterns for holiday versus regular period to correspond to a reduction in the reproductive number as high as 33% for some countries, whereas for others no significant decrease was observed [61] . Finally, such overall reduction does not allow to fully parametrize a contact matrix. Such evidence does not support the parameterization of mixing changes from different countries and/or epidemic situations (e.g. seasonal vs. pandemic) [45] . The reduction is expected to be heterogeneous across mixing groups, because of compensatory behaviors (e.g. children drastically reduce children-children contacts but increase childrenadults contacts during holidays) [61, 40] . Assumptions on the relative role of specific age classes in absence of data may lead to biases in the modeled epidemic outcome, especially for epidemics reporting large differences in attack rates in children vs. adults. Our work highlights the need to expand our knowledge on contacts and associated changes induced by social activity or by the epidemic itself, in order to better parameterize models and provide reliable and accurate results for epidemic management.Our study has a set of limitations that we discuss in the following. The host population is divided into two classes only. While a larger heterogeneity is known for the distribution of contacts across age classes [80] , our approach still accounts for the major role of children vs. adults in the spread of the disease. Moreover, the validation analysis shows that considering children and adults and the associated mixing and travel behavior is enough to reproduce the spatio-temporal unfolding of the epidemic to a good accuracy. Also, we did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic infec-tions. Santermans et al. [87] investigated the importance of dealing with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in an epidemic setting based on differences in mixing patterns between ill and healthy (as a proxy for asymptomatic) individuals. Future research should focus on combining the work of [87] with the study outlined here.The study is focused on one season only, the 2008/2009 influenza season. Additional seasons may clearly be included in the analysis, however our choice aimed at discounting season-specific effects to avoid uncertainties and discordance found in previous works. Also, we argue that the main effect behind the observed impact is in the interplay between the incidence profile and holidays timing, all other aspects being equal. To fully assess this aspect, we systematically explored earlier and later epidemics than the 2008/2009 season, thus synthetically accounting for other (similar) influenza seasons. We did not consider age-specific susceptibility, as it was largely addressed for example in studies related to the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic [21] . It would be interesting to explore its effects in future work in addition to social mixing and mobility, thus investigating additional seasonal influenza profiles.Our experimental scenarios in travel changes and mixing changes models consider neglecting travel changes and mixing changes in an independent way. The two aspects are expected to be intrinsically dependent, however no study has yet quantified this dependency that could inform a better experimental design. Also, we did not take into account uncertainties associated to the social contact rates estimated from the survey data, as previous work showed their limited impact in fitting serological data [55] .Mobility changes from commuting during regular weekdays to non-regular travel during weekends is obtained from travel statistics. We lack however specific data on travel behavior for adults during school holidays. We therefore assumed that adults would continue commuting during holiday weekdays. While we expect that a fraction of adults would stop commuting at least for few days during breaks as they take time off work, we expect this change in travel fluxes (compensated by additional trips to visit families [45] ) to have a negligible effect on the simulated epidemic. More drastic changes on travel, i.e. fully neglecting travel changes as in the mixing changes model, indeed did not alter the resulting epidemic.25 All rights reserved.

This may help the management of epidemics and lessen the pressure on the public health infrastructure. The effect is due to both school holidays and weekend closures, the latter periodically dampening transmission. Variations in travel behavior do not lead instead to visible effects. The observed impact strongly depends on the timing of the school closure, and to a lesser extent on its duration. Christmas holiday is the school break generally playing the most important role in mitigating the epidemic course, though variations are observed depending on the influenza season (e.g. early vs. late epidemic). The addition of one week extension after Christmas holiday may represent an additional strategy to further delay the epidemic peak and mitigate its impact.Abbreviations ILI: influenza-like-illness; SEIR: Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered; WLS: Weighted Least Square; GP: general practitioner; CI: confidence interval.Commuting data is available upon request from the Directorate General Statistics and Economic Information (DGSEI) [66] .

Agrobacterium-mediated delivery, similarly, is also limited to use in certain plant species, often yields random DNA integration that can adversely and unpredictably affect the cell operation (15) , results in constitutive expression of siRNA thus limiting temporal control over gene silencing, and can be difficult to scale or multiplex for high-throughput or multi-gene target applications, respectively (16) .While nanomaterial-mediated delivery of RNA and therapeutics has been extensively explored in animals (17) (18) (19) , its potential for plant systems remains understudied (20) . Several prior studies take advantage of nanomaterials to deliver plasmid DNA (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) or proteins (26) to intact plant cells. Polymeric nanoparticles have shown promise for siRNA delivery to cell wall-free plant protoplasts, but polymeric nanoparticles have not been shown to traverse the cell wall for gene silencing in intact plant cells (13) . A recent study has shown that clay nanosheets can facilitate delivery of pathogen-specific double-stranded RNA into intact plant cells for virus resistance (27) .Topical application of clay nanosheets enabled silencing of homologous RNA to provide sustained 20-day viral protection on the leaf surface.

In this study, we demonstrate the delivery of a different RNAi molecule -single-stranded siRNA -into intact cells of plant leaves using high-aspect-ratio one dimensional carbon nanomaterials: singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). SWNTs are biocompatible allotropes of carbon that have a high aspect ratio cylindrical nanostructure with diameters of 0.8-1.2 nm and lengths of 500-1000 nm. SWNTs are capable of passively crossing the extracted chloroplast envelope (28) and plant cell membranes (29) due to their high aspect ratio morphology, uniquely high stiffness, and small dimensions. SWNTs are among the few nanomaterials that can be synthesized to have a smallest dimension (~ 1 nm) below the plant size exclusion limit of ~20 nm, while also providing a large cylindrical surface area from the extrusion of their 1-dimension out to ~ 500 nm. The resulting large surface area to volume ratio is thus amenable to facile loading of appreciable quantities of biological cargoes such as siRNA. In contrast, spherical nanoparticles must often exceed the plant cell wall size exclusion limit to load necessary quantities of bio-cargoes, due to the reduced scaling of the spherical nanoparticle surface area to volume. Furthermore, when bound to SWNTs, biomolecules are protected from degradation in mammalian systems (30) , exhibiting superior biostability compared to free biomolecules; a phenomenon we show herein can extend to plants. Moreover, SWNTs have strong intrinsic near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence (31, 32) within the biological tissuetransparency window and beyond the chlorophyll autofluorescence range, and thus enable tracking of cargo-nanoparticle complexes deep in plant tissues.Prior usage of SWNTs in plant systems is limited to studies of SWNT biocompatibility (28, 33, 34) , sensing of small molecules (29, 35, 36) , and for delivery of All rights reserved.

To-date, there has yet to be a nanoparticle-based delivery platform for siRNA molecules into intact plant cells. Herein, we develop a SWNT-based siRNA delivery platform for the efficient silencing of an endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene in plant leaves. We show that SWNTs enable passive delivery (without external mechanical aid) and fluorescent-tracking of siRNA molecules in plant tissues. SWNTs present a non-toxic platform for siRNA delivery that uses a minimal siRNA dose to achieve silencing for up to 7 days, whereby silencing can be sustained upon re-infiltration of the siRNA-SWNT dose. With SWNT-mediated siRNA delivery, we achieve 95% gene silencing efficiency at the mRNA level, and show a significant delay in siRNA nuclease degradation in cells, and also at the single-molecule level, through protection by SWNTs. Taken altogether, SWNT-based delivery platform is rapid, scalable, facile to multiplex for multiple gene silencing targets, and speciesindependent (24, 33, (37) (38) (39) . In sum, this study establishes that SWNTs could be a promising resource to overcome plant RNA delivery limitations, and could enable a variety of plant biotechnology applications based on RNAi.In this study, we aim to validate SWNTs as a passive and effective siRNA delivery and gene silencing platform for use in intact cells of mature plants.

Herein, we tested two separate siRNA sequences (a-siRNA and b-siRNA) which target two slightly different regions of the mGFP5 gene for GFP silencing (Fig. 1a) .Loading of siRNA on SWNTs was accomplished by probe-tip sonication of each siRNA single-strand (sense, and separately antisense) with pristine SWNTs for both a-siRNA and b-siRNA sequences (Fig. 1b) . With this method, sense and antisense strands of siRNA were non-covalently adsorbed on SWNTs via Ï -Ï stacking of RNA nitrogen bases with the Ï bonds of sp 2 -hybridized carbons in SWNTs. The adsorption of RNA on SWNTs was confirmed for each sequence (a-antisense-SWNT, a-sense-SWNT, b-antisense-SWNT and b-sense SWNT) through the emergence of characteristic peaks in the individually-suspended SWNT absorbance (Fig. 1c) and nIR fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 1d) . We hypothesize and later verify that upon infiltration of an equimolar mixture of sense and antisense suspended SWNTs, these complementary siRNA strands desorb from the SWNT surface and hybridize to each other inside plant cells to form the active double-stranded siRNA silencing complex.

Successful suspension of SWNTs with non-targeting RNA sense and antisense strands was confirmed by absorbance and fluorescence spectra of individually suspended s-RNA-SWNTs Nb leaves were imaged with confocal microscopy to quantify Cy3 fluorescence inside leaf cells and in the extracellular area. In plants, the cytosol is pushed to the cell periphery due to the presence of a large central vacuole. Leaves infiltrated with Cy3-RNA-SWNTs showed a high degree of co-localization (70% Â± 8%, mean Â± SD) between the intracellular (cytosolic) GFP and Cy3 fluorescence originating from the nanocarriers, which confirms efficient internalization of RNA-SWNTs into intact cells (Fig. 2b ).

Additional confocal images of Cy3-RNA-SWNT and Cy3-RNA infiltrated leaves with representative higher and lower co-localization percentages are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2 . As a note here, a typical plant cell contains an organelle called vacuole, which is filled with water and occupies 80% of the cell volume.Therefore, any fluorescence localized in the cytoplasm follows the cytosolic cell contour shape ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).To investigate the effect of SWNT length on the cell internalization efficiency, we prepared short SWNTs through excessive probe-tip sonication. AFM images revealed that these short SWNTs have an average length of 250 nm; they are significantly shorter than SWNTs obtained with regular preparation (776 nm). We then loaded these short SWNTs with Cy3-RNA as before and checked internalization efficiency into GFP benthamiana cells with confocal microscopy. Interestingly, we found that short SWNTs have lower plant cell internalization efficiency compared to the longer ones, shown by respective average co-localization percentages of 47% and 70% ( Supplementary Fig.   4 ).

Following 6 hours of incubation, we imaged the infiltrated leaves with a custom-built nIR microscope equipped with a Raptor Ninox VIS-SWIR 640 camera, a 721 nm SWNT excitation laser, and a white lamp and appropriate filters to image GFP (see Methods). In leaves infiltrated with ssRNA-SWNTs, commensurate with Cy3-tagged confocal imaging results, we observe a high degree of co-localization between intracellular GFP and the nIR fluorescence of SWNTs (36, 43, 44) .After confirming that ssRNA adsorbed SWNTs can efficiently be uptaken by plant cells, we analyzed the thermodynamics of sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface, and their subsequent propensities for hybridization in the extracellular and intracellular conditions. According to our analysis (Supplementary Information), in the in vitro and extracellular area of the leaf tissue, sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface and hybridization is not thermodynamically favorable (âG>0), due to a high free energy cost of bare SWNTs in an aqueous All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564427 doi: bioRxiv preprint environment (Fig. 3a) . This unfavorable RNA desorption energy facilitates maintenance of intact RNA-SWNT conjugates in the extracellular environment until RNA-SWNTs enter cells. Once intracellular, sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface and hybridization is thermodynamically favorable (âG<0) because intracellular proteins, lipids, and other membrane and cytosolic biomolecules can occupy the SWNT surface and lower the associated free energy costs of RNA desorption (Fig. 3b ).Hybridization and desorption of sense and antisense RNA strands is verified with an in vitro experiment, where we mixed and incubated an equimolar mixture of a-sense-SWNT and a-antisense-SWNT suspensions for 3 h at room temperature; either in water or in plant cell lysate solution ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). We then eluted the desorbed siRNA and quantified it via absorbance at 260 nm. The results confirm that an insignificant amount of siRNA is desorbed when RNA-SWNTs incubated in water, whereas 66% of the siRNA is desorbed when incubated in plant cell lysate solution. We then ran the eluted RNA from the cell lysate sample on an agarose gel and showed that it is double-stranded, which verifies the formation of double-stranded siRNA in the cell cytosol. Additionally, zeta potential measurements of a-siRNA-SWNTs before and after hybridization in water and removal of desorbed RNA show unchanged nanoparticle zeta potential, suggesting there is not significant amount of RNA hybridizing and desorbing from SWNT surface in water ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

We have shown that 100 nM siRNA on SWNTs is an optimal dose to be used in mGFP5 silencing studies ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Transgenic Nb leaves that constitutively express GFP were imaged via confocal microscopy to quantify GFP silencing at the protein level. Representative confocal images of the leaves 2-days postinfiltration reveals that both a-siRNA-SWNTs and b-siRNA-SWNTs lead to significant reduction of GFP in cells, whereas GFP expression in leaves infiltrated with s-RNA-SWNT and free siRNA appears similar to GFP expression in non-treated leaves (Fig.   4a ). Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity from the confocal images of s-RNA-SWNTs and a-siRNA-SWNTs (see Methods) reveals that a-siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves have 38% Â± 3.2% (mean Â± SD) less GFP protein 3-days post-infiltration compared to the s-RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves. At 7-days post-infiltration, a-siRNA-SWNT shows roughly the same amount of GFP, 106.6 Â± 4.1% (mean Â± SD), as s-RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves (Fig. 4b) , as expected since gene silencing with siRNA is a transient process. GFP silencing with a-siRNA-SWNT was also verified with a Western blot analysis, where GFP extracted from the Nb leaves infiltrated with a-siRNA-SWNT is All rights reserved.

One day after infiltration of leaves with s-RNA-SWNT, free siRNA, a-siRNA-SWNT, and b-siRNA-SWNT, we extracted total RNA from the leaves and quantified the GFP mRNA transcript levels in each sample at Day 1 and 7. qPCR demonstrates that s-RNA-SWNT and free siRNA infiltrated leaves have the same amount of GFP mRNA transcript as the non-treated leaf, whereby a-siRNA-SWNT and b-siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves show 95% Â± 4.1% (mean Â± SD) and 92% Â± 6.2% (mean Â± SD) reduction in the GFP mRNA transcript levels at Day 1, respectively (Fig. 4d) . Similar to the confocal results, we found that mRNA transcript levels return back to the baseline levels as observed in non-treated leaves by Day 7 in all samples as a result of transient silencing (Fig. 4d) . Additionally, we show that we can recover GFP silencing at Day 7 by up to 71% Â± 2.9% (mean Â± SD) by re-infiltrating the leaf with second 100 nM a-siRNA-SWNT dose at Day 5 (Fig. 4e ). With the same technique, we also demonstrated the silencing of a functional endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene called ROQ1, which has implications in disease resistance against many pathogens (45) ( Supplementary   Fig. 8 ). Our results verify that SWNTs can also silence endogenous plant genes efficiently.All rights reserved.

To explore this hypothesis, we performed single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy to probe single siRNA strand susceptibility to degradation by RNase A when adsorbed on SWNTs, compared to single free siRNA. To do so, we labeled the a-antisense strand of GFP siRNA with a 5' terminal Cy3 fluorophore, and immobilized RNA-Cy3 and RNA-Cy3-SWNTs onto parallel channels of a microfluidic slide (see Methods). We measured the Cy3 fluorescence in each channel before and after treatment with RNase A, whereby percent decrease in the number of Cy3 molecules was used as a proxy for the percent siRNA degraded (Fig. 5a) . Our TIRF results show that 98% Â± 0.3% (mean Â± SD) of the initial Cy3-RNA immobilized on the channel surface is degraded after incubation with RNase A, whereas only 16% Â± 4.9% (mean Â± SD) of Cy3-RNA is degraded when it is bound to SWNTs, suggesting that SWNTs protect the siRNA cargo from enzymatic degradation inside cells (Fig. 5b) .

Agarose gel electrophoresis of free ssRNA vs. ssRNA-SWNTs incubated in plant cell lysate for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours demonstrate that free ssRNA is degraded significantly faster in cells compared to ssRNA adsorbed on SWNTs (Fig. 5c) . Band intensity quantification of agarose gel reveals that upon starting with 200 ng ssRNA, free ssRNA is completely degraded within 12 hours, whereas the ssRNA on the SWNTs is only completely degraded after 24 hours (Fig. 5d and 5e) , which corresponds to a 12 hour increase in the residence time of siRNA strands in cells when delivered through SWNTs. This gives rise to prolonged and increased silencing efficiency, as siRNA strands in cells have higher chance of hybridizing into the active complex before getting degraded by plant nucleases. With a similar in vitro cell lysate degradation experiment, we also show that after hybridization and desorption, double-stranded siRNA has high stability and it persists in cells for more than 4-days after formulation ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).SWNT biocompatibility, at the concentrations used in this study, was tested by qPCR analysis of a commonly used stress gene, and by tissue damage analysis via confocal microscopy. For qPCR toxicity analysis, we checked the upregulation of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog B (NbrbohB) gene (Fig. 5f ). NbrbohB upregulation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves represents stress response to many factors such as mechanical, light or heat damage (46) . qPCR results show that 2 mg/L RNA-SWNT All rights reserved.

Given the unchanged expression levels of stress gene NbrbohB, and healthy leaf tissue of RNA-SWNT infiltrated plants, we can conclude that 2 mg/L RNA-SWNTs are biocompatible for in planta RNAi applications.

We demonstrate here that high-aspect-ratio one dimensional SWNTs can successfully deliver siRNA molecules to efficiently silence a GFP gene in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana mature plant leaves, through a combination of i) effective intracellular delivery and ii) protection of the siRNA cargo from nuclease degradation. We found that RNA adsorbed SWNTs rapidly and efficiently internalize into the full leaf thickness of mature walled plant cells within 6 hours, in contrast to free RNA internalization which is minimal. We further found that Ï -Ï adsorption of siRNA on the SWNT surface delays intracellular siRNA degradation and thus prolongs silencing.Here, we developed a platform for siRNA delivery using nanoparticles, well suited for cellular delivery in plant tissues with intact cell walls. This platform utilizes SWNTs, to which single-stranded sense and antisense siRNA are adsorbed separately, enabling thermodynamically-favorable siRNA hybridization once intracellular for subsequent gene silencing mechanisms. We show that ssRNA is protected from degradation for up to 24 hours when adsorbed to SWNTs, whereas free ssRNA is almost completely degraded by 6 hours. We show a similar siRNA protection phenomenon with single-molecule TIRF microscopy of individual siRNA molecules either free or adsorbed to SWNTs. With this rapid and facile SWNT delivery platform, we achieve transient and DNA-free silencing of genes in mature plant leaves with a low siRNA-SWNT dose, showing mRNA knockdown efficiencies of up to 95% within 1 day post-infiltration, returning to native transcript levels by day 7.

Applications that require the introduction of repeated doses of siRNA-SWNTs may cause some long-term toxicity due to the nanoparticle accumulation in cells.However, studies should be undertaken to investigate the long-term effects of SWNT accumulation in plant cells.The commonly used cationic nanoparticles for the delivery of negatively charged siRNA through electrostatic interactions have shown appreciable cellular toxicity to cells for certain effective concentrations and/or charge densities (47) . The pristine noncharged SWNT surface eliminates this problem and makes it possible to scale-up the delivery of siRNA for higher doses or systemic administration. Additionally, the platform could be adapted to loading multiple siRNA sequences to multiplex gene silencing targets by delivering a mixture of SWNTs suspended with multiple siRNA sequences or loading a single SWNT sample with multiple siRNA sequences. Furthermore, SWNT internalization and polynucleotide delivery into plants is hypothesized to be speciesindependent, can be used with monocots, non-model species, hard-to-transform species, and cargo-carrying SWNTs are expected to diffuse into the full thickness of leaves providing a uniform transformation profile (24) .Given aforementioned advantages, we believe that there is a broad range of applications of our siRNA delivery platform. The process of RNA adsorption to SWNTs is based on Ï -Ï adsorption and thus agnostic to the function of the RNA cargo.Additional to the more traditional applications of RNAi in plants, such as disease/virus resistance, discovery of biosynthetic pathways, increasing the yield of small-molecule All rights reserved.

For instance, SWNTs could aid nuclease-based genome editing in plants by delivery of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and/or messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for controlled and transient nuclease expression and subsequent genome editing. Another potential application of SWNT-based RNA delivery is for increasing homology-directed repair (HDR) rates in plants for gene knock-in applications, which could possibly be achieved by suppressing the expression of the genes required for competitive nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathways (48) . As the efficient suppression of these genes is only desirable for the few-day time window in which genome editing takes place, our SWNT-mediated gene silencing platform could enable such control over transient siRNA delivery. As such, SWNT-based delivery of polynucleic acids is a useful resource to expand the plant biotechnology toolkit.Preparation of chemicals.

Two-step qPCR was performed to quantify GFP gene silencing in transgenic Nb plants as described in (24) .The target gene in our qPCR was mGFP5 (GFP transgene inserted into Nb), and EF1(elongation factor 1) as our housekeeping (reference) gene. Primers for these genes can be found in Supplementary Table 3 . An annealing temperature of 60ËC and 40 cycles were used for qPCR. qPCR data was analyzed by the ddCt method (51) as described in (24) . For each sample, qPCR was performed as 3 reactions from the same isolated RNA batch, and the entire experiment consisting of independent infiltrations and RNA extractions from different plants was repeated 3 times (3 biological replicates).Single molecule TIRF to image RNA protection by SWNTs. The a-antisense siRNA strand was utilized in this assay. 10 Î¼M 5' labelled Cy3-RNA was added to an equal mass of SWNTs. The RNA-SWNT suspension and removal of unbound RNA followed the same protocol as described in 'Quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments for gene silencing'. The positive control comprised of the same sequence that was 5' Cy3 labeled, and 3' biotin labeled. 6-channel Î¼-slides (ibidi, Î¼-Slide VI 0.5 Glass Bottom) were initially washed by pipetting 100 Î¼L of 100 mM sterile NaCl solutions into one reservoir and removing 60 Î¼L the other end, leaving just enough solution to fully wet the channel.

Briefly, 50 Î¼L of 0.25 mg/mL BSA-Biotin was added to coat the surface of the glass slide for 5 minutes. Next, 50 Î¼L of 0.05 mg/mL NeutrAvidin was added, followed by 50 Î¼L of 1.0 mg/L RNA-SWNT, which non-specifically adsorbs to NeutrAvidin. For the positive control, 50 Î¼L of 200 pM biotinylated Cy3-RNA was added in place of RNA-SWNT. The addition of each component comprised of a 5-minute incubation period, followed by flushing the channel with 50 Î¼L of NaCl solution to remove specimens that were not surface-immobilized. Each channel was exposed to 50 Î¼L of 10 Î¼g/mL RNase A for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the channel with 50 Î¼L NaCl solution. Slides were imaged with a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 microscope immediately following incubation with RNase A.To determine if SWNT adsorbed RNA is protected from nuclease degradation, we performed an agarose gel electrophoresis based RNA protection assay as described in (24) . 200 ng free RNA and RNA-SWNTs (carrying 200 ng RNA) were each incubated with cell lysate proteins obtained from one Nb leaf to mimic the intracellular degradation conditions for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.After incubation in cell lysate, all RNA (intact or not) was desorbed from the SWNT surface by heating at 95ËC for 1 hour in 2% SDS and 1.5 M NaCl solution. Desorbed RNA and cell lysate treated free RNA were run on a 1% agarose gel with RNA standards (200, 100, and 50 ng) to measure the intact versus degraded RNA in each sample lane. RNA amounts on the agarose gel were quantified by using band intensity as a proxy (ImageJ Gel Analyzer) and normalized with the lanes containing known RNA quantities. All rights reserved.

Moreover, the 48 rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population typically accelerates 49 throughout an epidemic as awareness of the infectious threat increases, 8 a process Drake et al 50 referred to as \"societal learning.\" 9 Obtaining accurate estimates of this time-varying removal of 51infected persons, while difficult, improves the quality of compartmental models for epidemics 52 of infectious disease. 9,10 To our knowledge, however, no work has directly compared the rate of 53 behavioral adaption across multiple epidemics, societies, and geographic settings. 54 55Many factors can affect how quickly effective isolation practices are implemented, such as 56 access to health care, local public health funding, international aid, and the efficacy of 57 information campaigns. 11 Local health care practices and non-formal healthcare systems also 58 provide care to patients during epidemics and can play a part in quarantining infected 59individuals. 12 Previous work in Liberia has shown that a combination of these approaches 60 through simultaneous community engagement and clinical intervention is more effective than 61any single intervention, with both health care access and utilization increasing hand-in-hand to 62decrease EVD transmission during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. 13 While infection prevention 63often includes vaccination, progress to develop effective vaccines for emerging infections is 64 slow and not necessarily more effective than isolation of infected individuals. 14 Ring vaccination 65with the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine 15 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 66promising, 16 but previous work has suggested that ring vaccination may only provide a marginal 67 benefit to rigorous contact tracing and patient isolation. 17 68 69The focus of this paper is the identification of key similarities and differences in the behavioral 70 response to outbreaks of three emerging zoonotic infections. We sought to determine how the 71 mean removal rate of infected individuals changed over the course of each outbreak as 72 measured by epidemic week and viral serial interval. Individuals often experience zoonotic and 73 emerging infections as innately more frightening than \"familiar\" diseases, leading to rapid 74 behavioral adaptations due to high perceived risk. 18 We compiled data for each outbreak location binned by epidemic week, to produce comparable 97 data for regression analysis. Epidemic weeks came from weekly onset dates described above. 98We also binned the same data by serial interval, using 12 days as the estimated serial interval 99for Ebola, 23 8 days for SARS, 24 and 7 days for MERS; 27 this was calculated as epidemic 100week/(serial interval/7). Each dataset included, per week, the number of new cases, the 101 cumulative number of cases, mean DSOH and associated standard deviation, and MRR and 102 associated standard deviation. We removed epidemic weeks from the beginning of each 103 outbreak so that the first three epidemic weeks had greater than 0 cases of disease each in 104 order to focus on population-level behavioral adaptation to large-scale disease outbreaks 105instead of adaptations to individual disease events early in an epidemic. We performed all 106 regression analyses using this binned data. 107 108Initial regression analyses fit linear models to predict DSOH and MRR ( week) more than the 165 mean change in the 166 MRR of the Liberian 167Ebola epidemic (Fig.  168 2). The mean change 169 of the MRR in the 170Ebola epidemic in Lofa 171County, Liberia, was 172 significantly higher than the mean change of the MRR for the overall Liberian epidemic and the 173 .

The three MERS outbreaks (Riyadh, Jeddah, and South Korea) did not differ 175 significantly from one another and had limited precision (Fig. 2) . 176 177We narrowed the 195 associated confidence intervals (Fig. 2) . We identified little difference in the mean change of 196 the MRR for the Ebola outbreak depending on predictor (Fig. 2) While our findings demonstrate large and statistically significant differences in MRR, it is 231notable that the calculated rates of change in the MRRs are within a factor of ten (when 232 calculated using epidemic week) to seven (when calculated using serial interval) of each other 233 (Fig. 2) , with the mean change being the lowest in the EVD outbreak in Liberia and the highest 234in the MERS outbreak in South Korea. For modelers seeking to understand the epidemiology of 235 emerging infectious diseases with limited or no data from previous outbreaks, this study 236 provides a range of acceptable values for the MRR based on seven geographically distinct 237 outbreaks of three emerging diseases. Similarly, while large disparities in DSOH are obvious (Fig.  238 1), these data highlight that all societies quickly adapt to outbreaks of emerging infections. We have shown that public health practices for isolating infected individuals from the 249 susceptible population vary significantly by pathogen and location, but can in some cases be 250 predicted by the timing and serial interval of the epidemic. This study detected variation in 251 DSOH and MRR based on epidemic location and outbreak type, indicating that it may be 252 possible to estimate a general range of the rate of change in these variables over time. Due to 253location-specific differences in DSOH and MRR, modelers who seek to develop forecasts early in 254 an outbreak would benefit from estimating an expected range for removal of infected 255 individuals using data from past outbreaks of the same pathogen in a similar setting. 256Furthermore, the quality of these estimates will be impacted by the metric chosen, as seen by 257 the notable, but distinct, trends detected in DSOH and MRR. As seen in this study, utilizing a 258well-chosen response variable with a relatively small amount of data can provide material for 259making effective forecasts about public health behavior. \n","Humans astroviruses (HAstVs) belong to genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae.ORF1b (RdRp) amino acid sequences were extracted and aligned, and a phylogenetic tree constructed (Fig. S1 ). We follow the genogroups defined in Yokoyama et al. 8 . Although the more-divergent CP sequences may provide a less robust phylogenetic analysis, we also constructed a CP-based phylogenetic tree to test for possible recombination (Fig. S2 ). At the level of genogroup the ORF1b and CP trees were consistent, although within genogroups there were some differences between the topologies of the two trees. For simplicity, we used the ORF1b tree to define astrovirus clades for full-genome analyses.We grouped astrovirus sequences into clades (Fig. 1B) , generated codon-based alignments of concatenated ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2 coding sequences within each clade, and analyzed the alignments with synplot2 which tests for regions where synonymous substitutions occur less often than average for the sequence alignment 9 . Regions with significantly enhanced synonymous site conservation typically harbour overlapping functional elements which constraint sequence evolution 9 . The analysis of subgroup \"Ia\" astroviruses ( Fig. 1B ; classical HAstVs besides some feline and sea lion astroviruses) revealed conserved elements at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b (representing the ribosomal frameshifting signal and ORF1a/ORF1b overlap), upstream of ORF2 (presumed to represent elements involved in sgRNA synthesis), towards the 3â² end of ORF2 (possible replication elements), and overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 (the putative overlapping ORFX) (Fig. 1C) . We applied the same analysis to 13 other astrovirus genogroup or sub-genogroup clades, revealing conserved regions overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally (see below for exceptions), not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S3) .We repeated the synonymous site conservation analysis using clades, sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees based on only ORF2 in order to rule out potential artefacts as a result of possible recombination between the nonstructural and structural modules of the virus genome, and to include additional part-genome sequences (total 415 sequences with ORF2 coverage; Fig. 1D; Fig. S4 ). This analysis revealed conserved regions overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 throughout genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally, not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S5 ). Those clades with synonymous site conservation also contain a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF, whereas those sequences without synonymous site conservation generally also lacked a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5) .Interestingly, we also detected synonymous site conservation in two subgroups of genogroup II astroviruses ( Fig. S3G; Fig. S3H ). In subgroup \"IId\", the conservation coincided with a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5E) ; however in subgroup \"IIc\", there was no conserved ORF in the +1 reading frame. Instead, we observed an ORF in the â1 reading frame . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

It seems plausible that ORFX and ORFY in genogroup II astroviruses may have evolved independently of ORFX in other astrovirus genogroups (see Discussion).Evidence for ORFX was also found in a clade of rodent astroviruses of unassigned genogroup ( Fig. S3D; Fig. S5L ). Further, a number of unclustered divergent sequences also contain long +1 frame ORFs overlapping the 5â² end of ORF2 that potentially encode XP proteins (Fig. S7 ).Note that genogroup V -represented by a single partial sequence, FJ890355 (bottlenose dolphin astrovirus 1) -is one of these. Table S1 ). Similar to other overlapping genes, which generally evolve de novo 11 , the XP peptide sequences show little to no homology to known protein domains. Many XP sequences contain a predicted TM domain, and some other XPs contain a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that resembles a TM domain despite being scored below threshold by Phobius (Fig. S8, Fig. S9 ).To test for XP expression in infected cells, we first raised various antibodies against XP peptides and we also tested the viability of tagged-XP viruses. However, neither antibody nor tagged virus approaches were successful. Thus we turned to ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq). Ribo-Seq is a high throughput sequencing technique that globally maps the footprints of initiating or elongating 80S ribosomes on mRNAs 12, 13 . We infected Caco2 cells and performed Ribo-Seq at 12 hours post infection (hpi). Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as previously described 14 (Fig.   S10 ). Using flash-freezing with no drug pre-treatment (NT), we mapped the translational landscape of the HAstV1 genome ( Fig. 2A) . ORF2 is translated at ~9ï´ the level of ORF1a, whereas ORF1b is translated at ~25% the level of ORF1a, indicating a ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of ~25%. The higher expression of ORF2 is likely a result of higher levels of sgRNA than gRNA in the translation pool. To identify translation initiation sites, we utilized the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM), which acts preferentially on the initiating ribosome but not on the elongating ribosome 15 . LTM binds to the 80S ribosome already assembled at the initiation codon and occupies the empty exit (E-site) of initiating ribosomes, thus completely blocking translocation. Using this approach, we confirm the two previously known initiation . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Such reads will not ligate to the adapter oligonucleotides and thus will be excluded from sequencing. This may explain why the ORF2 initiation peak is smaller than the ORF1a initiation peak, even though ORF2 is expressed at much higher levels than ORF1a. Thus we cannot quantify the ORF2:ORFX expression ratio from the LTM data.Ribosome profiling of eukaryotic systems typically has the characteristic that mappings of the 5â² end positions of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) to coding sequences reflect the triplet periodicity (herein referred to as \"phasing\") of genetic decoding. For our datasets, the great majority of RPF 5â² ends map to the first nucleotide of codons (Fig. 2C, left) . Reads mapping to the ORF2/ORFX part of the genome (NT samples) were quantified in the three possible phases.In the region of ORF2 that is overlapped by ORFX we observed an increased number of reads mapping in the +1 phase relative to the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 2C , middle) compared to the region of ORF2 that is not overlapped by ORFX (Fig. 2C , right) or the coding regions of host mRNAs (Fig. 2C, left) . Quantification of the differences in phasing indicated that ORFX is translated at ~27% of the level of ORF2, although it should be noted that reporter assays (see below) are expected to provide more accurate quantification than RPF phasing analysis.XP-knockout viruses are attenuated but pseudo-revert on passage.To evaluate the significance of ORFX in the context of virus infection, a set of mutant virus genomes was created based on the pAVIC1 infectious clone 16 by introducing mutations that knock out ORFX without affecting the CP amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) . Four independent mutations were introduced to guard against the possibility of affecting potential RNA secondary structures overlapping with this region, resulting in pAVIC1-AUGm (AUG to ACG), pAVIC1-PTC1 (stop codon after 20 amino acids), pAVIC1-2ÃPTC (double stop codon after 20 amino acids) and pAVIC1-PTC2 (stop codon after 73 amino acids) ( Fig. 3B; Fig. S11 ). Corresponding T7 RNA transcripts were used for virus rescue in Huh7.5.1 cells followed by infection in Caco2 cells. All four ORFX knockout viruses were strongly attenuated compared to wt virus (Fig. 3C ).After seven blind passages in Caco2 cells, two mutant viruses (pAVIC1-AUGm and pAVIC1-.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint PTC1) demonstrated an ï¾1 log increase in virus titers, which was achieved via a pseudoreversion (pAVIC1-AUGm) or 5 or 8 codon deletions (pAVIC1-PTC1) (Fig. 3C ). All three mutations would result in restoration of XP expression, confirming its importance in virus growth.XP is essential for virus release but has only a minor effect on RNA replication.ORFX overlaps ORF2, which encodes the structural polyprotein, and therefore the expression of XP is likely required in late stages of the virus replication cycle. To rule out the possibility of XP directly influencing viral RNA replication, we developed a replicon system comprising an intact astrovirus genome up to the end of ORFX, followed by a 2A-RLuc cassette fused in either the ORF2 or ORFX reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig. 4A) . These replicons provide a direct measurement of translated product associated with activity of the subgenomic promoter. Two ORFX knock-out mutations were copied in both versions of the replicon to evaluate the significance of XP for RNA replication (Fig. 4B ). Experiments were performed in BSR and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, both of which have been reported to support astrovirus replication 16, 17 . Replication was confirmed by an 1200-2100 fold difference in relative luciferase activity between wt and an RdRp knockout mutant (GDD â GNN) at 9 and 12 hours post transfection (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). The mutations introduced to knock out ORFX had minor effect on luciferase activity when 2A-RLuc was fused in the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). Consistent with our Ribo-Seq results (Fig.   2C ), luciferase activity for the ORFX reading frame was 14% (BSR cells; Fig. 4C ) and 21% (Huh7.5.1 cells; Fig. S12A ) of luciferase activity for the ORF2 reading frame. Thus, ORFX is efficiently translated but has only a minor (if any) direct effect on viral RNA replication.As expected, both XP knockout mutations resulted in a substantial drop in ORFX-frame luciferase activity (Fig. 4D, Fig. S12B ). This drop was more pronounced for the PTC mutant (5.5Â±0.7% wt in BSR cells and 4.1Â±1.7% in Huh7.5.1 cells) than for the AUGm mutant (AUG to ACG; 17.9Â±0.1% wt in BSR cells and 13.2Â±0.3% in Huh7.5.1 cells). ACG codons are known to permit initiation when in a strong initiation context (e.g. A at â3 and G at +4 as in the AUGm mutant) 18 . Since we wished to only use mutations that were synonymous in ORF2, we were unable to mutate the ORFX AUG codon in any other way. When utilized as an initiation codon, ACG is expected to be decoded as methionine by initiator Met-tRNA. Therefore the AUGm mutant is still expected to produce wt XP, albeit at a greatly reduced level. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe astrovirus subgenomic promoter is also situated within this region of the astrovirus genome ( Fig. 4A ). Although effective replication occurred even in the absence of XP translation (Fig.   4C ), the introduced mutations could still have a potential effect on sgRNA production via alteration of RNA structure and/or other interactions. To map the minimal region required for wt levels of sgRNA production in the context of the pO2RL replicon, we gradually truncated the sequence between the start of ORF2 and ORFX. Surprisingly, we found that a replicon containing only the first 4 or 28 nucleotides of ORF2 has very poor subgenomic reporter activity (0.6Â±0.03 and 12.5Â±0.1% that of wt pO2RL, respectively). In contrast, including the first 46 nucleotides of ORF2 restored subgenomic reporter activity to 92% of wt (Fig. 4F , S12C). These data suggest that the astrovirus subgenomic promoter is significantly longer than previously reported 19 and extends into the 5â² part ORF2, but does not appear to extend into ORFX.To determine which stage of the virus replication cycle is affected in XP knock-out viruses, we quantified released virus and viral protein and RNA levels for BSR cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed full-length pAVIC1 T7 RNAs. As expected, neither RNA nor protein levels were affected in cell-derived samples (Fig. 4G ). In contrast, in media-derived samples, XP mutant titers were significantly below wt titers when analyzed by qRT-PCR (fold differences = 0.08 and 0.05, p = 0.002 and 0.003 for AUG vs wt and PTC vs wt respectively; 2-tailed t-tests with separate variances) or virus titration (Fig. 4G ). These analyses indicate the involvement of XP late in the virus replication cycle, with XP potentially acting in either virus assembly or virus release. Since previous structural studies on the HAstV CP 20 and virion 21 have not indicated the presence of any additional proteins in the compact 43-nm virion structure, the more likely role for XP is in virus release.XP localizes to plasma membrane and perinuclear membranes with an extracellular Nterminus topology.To further investigate the function of XP, we studied its intracellular localization. To make the small XP protein more stable and enable visualization in transfected cells, we fused it either Nor C-terminally with mCherry in the context of a mammalian expression vector. The diffuse cytoplasmic localization of mCherry was drastically affected in both fusions, where it was relocalized to plasma and perinuclear membranes (Fig. 5A ). This strongly suggests the presence of a membrane-interacting domain in XP, which was not predicted by TM domain prediction software ( Fig. S8 ; see Methods). Since ORFX is completely embedded within ORF2, it may have greatly decreased evolutionary flexibility, perhaps resulting in the evolution of a non-. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Some of the putative XP proteins encoded by other astroviruses do in fact have predicted TM regions (Fig. S9 ). We also confirmed membrane and nuclear association of the XP-fused mCherry proteins by subcellular fractionation of transfected HeLa cells and subsequent analysis of the fractions (Fig. 5B ). To investigate the potential topology of XP within the plasma membrane, we probed live electroporated HeLa cells with anti-mCherry antibody, fixed the cells and analyzed them by confocal microscopy. We observed punctate staining across the plasma membrane when mCherry was fused to the N-terminus but not when it was fused to the C-terminus, suggesting an extracellular N-terminal topology and potential multimerization ( Fig. 5C-D) .XPs from HAstV1 and related astroviruses have a viroporin-like activity.Given the above results, we hypothesized a possible viroporin function for XP. Viroporins are virus-encoded ion channel proteins which disturb membrane integrity leading to permeabilization. Given the C-terminal below-threshold TM predictions for HAstV XPs (Fig.   S8 ), we hypothesized that the C-terminal region might harbour a TM pore-forming domain.Additional support came from Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles (Fig. 6B ) and a Cterminal Î±-helical structure prediction for HAstV1-8 XPs (Fig. S14) . A helical wheel representation of this region revealed a penta-leucine hydrophobic face in HAstV1 (Fig. 6A ).Although these leucines are not entirely conserved between the eight HAstV serotypes (Fig.   1F ), each XP was still predicted to contain an amphipathic Î±-helix in this region 22 . To test for viroporin-like activity, we utilized a previously described Sindbis virus replicon (SINV repC) 23 to overexpress XP or control proteins in mammalian cells. This replicon has been demonstrated to be an extremely useful tool for investigating viroporins from different RNA viruses via induced permeabilization of the plasma membrane in BHK cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B (HB). BSR cells (a clone of BHK cells) were electroporated with in vitro transcribed SINV repC RNAs, and new protein synthesis was labelled with Lazidohomoalanine (AHA) in the presence or absence of HB, followed by lysis and click chemistry-based on-gel detection 24 . Expression of XP or Strep-tagged enterovirus 2B (a wellcharacterized viroporin 25 ) led to almost total inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 6C-D) indicating that both proteins induced pronounced cell permeabilization to HB.Another widely used assay to assess the ability of proteins to permeabilize cellular membranes is based on impaired growth of Escherichia coli upon induced overexpression of a membranepermeabilizing protein 26, 27 . Consistent with the results observed in the mammalian system, . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

There are two features that are generally associated with viroporin membrane permeabilizing activity: (i) an amphipathic Î±-helix that facilitates oligomerization to form the TM pore, and (ii) adjacent positively charged residues that anchor the viroporin in the membrane 27, 28 . To test for these features in XP, two conserved RR motifs present in all eight HAstV serotypes (Fig. 1F ) were mutated to alanines (Fig. 6F) . Interestingly, only the mutation of the very C-terminal arginines resulted in loss of XP activity in this system (Fig.   6G ). Mutation of the hydrophobic leucine stretch (L95, L98, L102, L105 and L109, Fig. 6A ) to serines and threonines (Fig. 6F ) also resulted in complete loss of XP activity (Fig. 6G) . Thus, the C-terminal domain of XP is involved in membrane permeabilization and harbours key features of a viroporin.To investigate conservation of XP activity across different astrovirus species, we tested several other astrovirus XPs in the bacterial lysis assay. We used XPs from closely related HAstV4, feline (FAstV; genotype Ia), canine (CAstV; genotype Ib) and distantly related porcine (PAstV4; genotype IIIc) astroviruses in this experiment (Fig. 6H ). Protein expression constructs were created to express XPs with N-or C-terminal Strep tags, and combinations resulting in detectable protein were chosen for the assay. Induction of each of the four XPs resulted in strong inhibition of bacterial growth (Fig. 6I) , with XP expression confirmed by western blot (Fig. 6J ).Similar to HAstV XPs, all tested proteins contain one or two predicted amphipathic Î±-helices ( Fig. S15) . Thus, these findings indicate that this newly identified astrovirus protein has a membrane-permeabilizing function.The data presented here demonstrate the existence of an additional protein, XP, encoded within the human astrovirus genome. XP is important for virus growth, localizes to the plasma membrane, and plays a role in virus release. Viroporins have been reported for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and -although they can play roles in virus entry and modulation of cellular pathways -most often they facilitate virus assembly or release 26 . However, no viroporin candidate had been previously predicted for astroviruses. Identifying a viroporin is challenging due to the lack of homology among viroporins from different viruses. Viroporins are typically small hydrophobic integral membrane proteins of around 100 aa in size, with two motifs -an amphipathic Î±-helix and an adjacent cluster of positively charged residues; mutation of these residues generally abolishes viroporin activity 27 . Using two different assays and . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint computational approaches, we show that XP fulfils these criteria. XP is capable of permeabilizing cellular membranes and has a distinct N-terminal extracellular topology with one TM domain, thus making XP a candidate class IA viroporin, a class which also includes the influenza A virus M2, coronavirus E and HIV-1 Vpu proteins 26, 28 . Future work will be needed to confirm potential ion channel activity, and characterize ion specificity, structural organisation, and processes affected by XP expression in the context of viral infection. The localization of XP not only at the plasma membrane but also in the perinuclear region raises the possibility that XP may also have additional functions. Whereas the C-terminal Î±-helix appears to be associated with the cell-permeabilizing activity, additional functions (if any) of the extended N-terminal domain of XP remain to be studied.Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the presence of a protein-coding ORF overlapping ORF2 is widespread in mammalian astroviruses. It appears to be almost ubiquitous in genogroups I, III and IV and is probably present in the single genogroup V sequence. It also appears to be present in various unassigned sequences and clades. ORFX frequently has a hydrophobic stretch that is often predicted to be a TM domain and in other cases may represent a non-canonical TM domain refractory to detection with standard TM-predicting software (as appears to be the case for HAstV1). While normally absent from genogroup II astroviruses, an ORFX appears to be present in one clade (herein referred to as IId), whereas in the clade referred to herein as IIc we predicted an ORFY in the â1 instead of +1 frame, and accessed via ribosomal frameshifting instead of leaky scanning. Given the sporadic appearance of an overlapping ORF across the genogroup II phylogeny, it seems likely that the genogroup II ORFX and ORFY evolved independently from ORFX in genogroups I, III and IV, and may also therefore have different functions. In contrast, these other ORFXs may or may not have a common ancestor and/or common function (it is unclear to what extent genogroups I, III and IV form a monophyletic group; Fig. S1, Fig. S2 ). The N-terminal ~70 aa of CP are dispensable for particle assembly and likely structurally disordered 20 and may therefore be evolutionarily fairly flexible. Thus, this region of ORF2 may be unusually tolerant to the coding constraints imposed by overlapping genes. Together with the high translation level of sgRNAs at later timepoints ( Fig. 2A) , and the ease with which 5â² proximal ORFs can be expressed (requiring only leaky scanning rather than more complex expression mechanisms such as internal ribosome entry or ribosomal frameshifting 10 ), the 5â² region of the sgRNA may be particularly well-suited to the evolution of an overlapping gene, consistent with multiple independent origins of ORFXs.During this study we also developed and characterized the first astrovirus replicon system. This will be of broad utility to the astrovirus research community. Astroviruses are one of the major . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Nonetheless, despite their ubiquity and importance, astroviruses represent some of the least well-studied human viruses, partly because it has been difficult to establish efficient lab systems to study them. The replicon system developed herein will now permit detailed characterization of astrovirus replication and gene expression, and facilitate research into antiviral drugs.In summary, using comparative genomic analyses we predicted a new gene in the Mamastrovirus genus; using ribosome profiling we demonstrated XP expression in HAstV1infected cells; and using a range of techniques we demonstrated the crucial role of XP in virus growth by promoting virus release, which is likely associated with its membranepermeabilizing activity. These findings add a new dimension to astrovirus molecular biology, with potential impacts for new therapeutics (e.g. compounds that block XP activity) and vaccine development (e.g. by inhibiting XP expression).Mammalian astrovirus nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on 26 July 2018. Patent sequence records and sequences with â¥20 ambiguous nucleotide codes (e.g. \"N\"s) were removed. For the full-genome analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 were retained, giving 221 sequences (listed in Fig. S1 ). For the ORF2 analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF2 were retained, giving 415 sequences (listed in Supplementary Dataset 1) . To identify the correct 5â² end of ORF1b, we identified the AAAAAAC frameshift site. To identify the correct initiation site of ORF2, we identified the highly conserved sgRNA promoter nucleotides 29 and selected the next ORF2-frame AUG codon as the ORF2 start site in representative reference sequences; for the other sequences, the ORF2 start site was identified by amino acid alignment to one of the reference sequences. ORF1b and ORF2 sequences were extracted, translated to amino acid sequences, aligned with MUSCLE 30 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint acid rate matrices, with 1,000,000 (221-sequence trees; Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 ) or 5,000,000 (415sequence tree; Fig. S4 ) generations, discarding the first 25% as burn-in (other parameters were left at defaults). Trees were visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).The 221-sequence ORF1b tree was used to manually select clades (Fig. 1B) for full-genome SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S3) . For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S5) , we used a more objective method to select clades. Through an iterative procedure of clustering the 415 ORF2 sequences based on amino acid identity to a set of reference sequences, and selecting sequences distal from all reference sequences as new reference sequences, we arrived at a set identity to a reference, and only 20 have <55% identity; 82 and 4 sequences have >50% and >55% identity, respectively, to >1 references. Each non-reference sequence was then clustered with the reference sequence to which it has highest CP amino acid identity. This resulted in 16 singleton clusters and 26 multi-sequence clusters.Synonymous site conservation was analyzed with SYNPLOT2 9 . For the full-genome analyses we generated codon-respecting alignments using a procedure described previously 9 . In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 32 . Genomes were then mapped to reference sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined to give the multiple sequence alignment. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 coding regions were extracted from the alignment (with codons selected from the longer ORF in each overlap region), concatenated inframe, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 using a 25-codon sliding window.Conservation statistics were then mapped back to reference genome coordinates for plotting.For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses, any duplicate sequences were removed and the remaining ORF2 sequences in each clade were translated, aligned using MUSCLE as amino acid sequences, back-translated to codon-respecting nucleotide alignments, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 as above. In contrast to the full-genome alignments, all alignment gaps were retained instead of mapping to a specific reference sequence coordinate system.

TM domains were predicted with Phobius (EMBL-EBI) 34 . The XP proteins of HAstVs 1-8 were additionally queried with TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; weak TM prediction for HAstV3, no TM predicted for other HAstVs) and SOSUI (http://harrier.nagahama-ibio.ac.jp/sosui/sosui_submit.html; no TMs predicted). XP secondary structures were predicted with RaptorX 35 . To search for potential homologues of XP, XPs from Fig. S6D, Fig. S7 and The infectious clone of HAstV1 (pAVIC1, GenBank accession number L23513.1) was described previously 16 . The reverse genetics procedure was compiled from several previously published approaches 16, 17 . Initial virus was recovered from T7 transcribed RNA using reverse transfection of Huh7.5.1 cells by LipofectamineÂ® 2000 (Invitrogen) (for virus rescue, see Fig. 3) or electroporation of BSR cells in PBS at 800 V and 25 ÂµF using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell TM electroporation system (see Fig. 4 for an analysis of virus RNA in cells versus released particles). For virus passaging, the collected supernatant was treated with 10 Âµg/ml trypsin (Type IX, Sigma, #T0303) for 30 min at 37 Â°C, diluted 5 times with serum-free media, and used for infection of Caco2 cells. After 3 h of incubation, the virus containing media was replaced with serum free media containing 0.6 Âµg/ml trypsin, and cells were incubated for 48-72 h until appearance of CPE. After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, the viral stocks were aliquoted, frozen and stored at â70 Â°C. Viral stocks were titrated as previously described 35 , but using infrared detection readout, combined with automated LI-COR software-based quantification. For mammalian expression of XP, the coding sequence of mCherry alone or HAstV1 XP fused to mCherry at either the N-or C-terminus was inserted into vector pCAG-PM 36 using AflII and PacI restriction sites. The resulting constructs -designated pCAG-mCherry, pCAG-XP-mCherry, and pCAG-mCherry-XP -were confirmed by sequencing.All virus genome mutations (Fig. S11) were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis of pAVIC1 and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. To create the HAstV1 replicon system, the pAVIC1 infectious clone was left intact up to the end of ORFX, then followed by a foot and mouth disease virus 2A sequence and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) sequence fused in either the ORF2 (pO2RL) or ORFX (pXRL) reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig.   4A ). All mutations were introduced from the corresponding pAVIC1 mutants using available restriction sites and all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. Each XP coding sequence was inserted into the pOPT plasmid with a C-or N-terminal Streptag as indicated (Fig. 6I) .

The cells were Ribo-Seq analysis was performed as described previously 14 . Adaptor sequences were trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit) and trimmed reads shorter than 25 nt were discarded. Reads were mapped to host (Homo sapiens) and virus RNA using bowtie version 1 39 , with parameters -v 2 --best (i.e. maximum 2 mismatches, report best match).Mapping was performed in the following order: host rRNA, virus RNA, host RefSeq mRNA, host non-coding RNA, host genome.To normalize for library size, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator. A +12 nt offset was applied to the RPF 5â² end positions to give the approximate ribosomal P-site positions. To calculate the phasing and length distributions of host and virus RPFs, only RPFs whose 5â² end (+12 nt offset) mapped between the 13th nucleotide from the beginning and the 18th nucleotide from the end of coding sequences (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 for HAstV;RefSeq mRNAs for host) were counted, thus avoiding RPFs near initiation and termination sites. For Fig. S10 , the dual-coding region where ORFX overlaps ORF2 was also excluded.Histograms of host RPF positions (5â² end +12 nt offset) relative to initiation and termination sites were derived from RPFs mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated coding regions â¥450 nt in length and with annotated 5â² and 3â² UTRs â¥60 nt in length. Virus ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 ribosome densities (used herein as a proxy for translation levels) were calculated by counting RPFs whose 5â² end (+12 nt offset) mapped within the regions 101-2782, 2866-4311 .

At 48 hpe media samples were collected and centrifuged at 9,600 g for 5 min. The released virus samples were titrated on Caco2 cells as described above. For RT-qPCR analysis, a 150 Âµl aliquot of each sample was mixed with 4 Ã 10 6 Lysates from the above mentioned assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using standard 12% SDS-PAGE to resolve mCherry and its XP-fusion variants, and precast Novexâ¢ 10-20% tricine protein gels (Thermo Fisher) to resolve XPs and enterovirus 2B. Proteins were then transferred to 0.2 Âµm nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 4% Marvel milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Immunoblotting of mCherry was performed using anti-mCherry antibody (Abcam, ab167453). A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against XP peptide SNSGNRVSQDQNLQ (GenScript; only able to detect strongly overexpressed XP) and an anti-Strep mouse antibody (Abcam, ab184224) were used for detecting HAstV1 XP and Strep-tagged proteins, respectively. The following antibodies were used for cellular targets:anti-tubulin (Abcam, ab15568), anti-VDAC1 (Abcam, ab14734), and anti-LAMIN A+C (Abcam, ab133256).

enti e istituzioni pubblici e privati nonch dalle societ scientifiche e dalle associazioni tecnicoscientifiche delle professioni sanitarie iscritte apposito elenco ha rinnovato l impulso legislativo culturale professionale e scientifico alla diffusione delle lg nel servizio sanitario nazionale l attuale quadro regolamentare italiano prevede che la loro produzione venga garantita sulla base degli standard di predisposizione e valutazione della qualit metodologica definiti dal centro nazionale per l eccellenza clinica cnec dell istituto superiore di sanit punto di riferimento per l attuazione del nuovo sistema nazionale linee guida istituito con il dm febbraio secondo la vigente definizione adottata dal cnec le lg sono uno strumento di supporto decisionale finalizzato consentire che fra opzioni alternative sia adottata quella che offre un migliore bilancio fra benefici ed effetti indesiderati tenendo conto della esplicita e sistematica valutazione delle prove disponibili commisurandola alle circostanze peculiari del caso concreto e condividendola laddove possibile con il paziente caregiver le linee guida servono dunque supportare processi decisionali che connotano la pratica professionale preventiva diagnostica terapeutica e assistenziale anche le scelte manageriali e le politiche sanitarie ai diversi livelli del sistema sanitario infatti la disponibilit di lg fondamentale per contrastare alcune delle criticit sistemiche della sanit connesse tra l altro erogazione di cure di qualit sub ottimale alla variazione ingiustificata di pratiche ed esiti e alle diseguaglianze un quadro di risorse limitate se dunque oggi il valore delle linee guida per la pratica clinica indiscutibile tutti gli ambiti disciplinari della medicina peculiare il significato professionale e organizzativo che le stesse possono assumere nello sviluppo e nella specifica applicazione alla sanit pubblica particolare la sanit pubblica si caratterizza per la forte eterogeneit nelle evidenze scientifiche disponibili non di rado costituite solamente da studi osservazionali l adozione di un approccio di population health e la frequente individuazione di target costituiti da persone sane la molteplicit anche relazione importanza attribuita dagli stakeholder coinvolti degli ambiti di produzione di linee guida www int publication guideline degli interventi sanitari e degli outcome individuati nei contesti reali e non di ricerca condizionati da una molteplicit di variabili culturali organizzative socio economiche e ambientali spesso le raccomandazioni prodotte sanit pubblica sono destinate ad avere un impatto quali quantitativamente molto rilevante sul sistema sanitario e necessitano di modelli grado di prevederne l implementazione non sempre agevolmente correlabili alle evidenze scientifiche disponibili priori altres il percorso di costruzione del consenso e implementazione degli interventi articolato e complesso misura maggiore rispetto ad altre discipline mediche comportamenti degli operatori non si basano solo sulle conoscenze tecnico scientifiche disponibili talora limitate e non sempre esplicitamente generalizzabili risentono e sono condizionati da dettati normativi meccanismi di consenso locale eterogeneit di strutture erogatrici e risorse professionali organizzative e tecnologiche nonch da relazioni con una molteplicit di portatori di interesse dentro e fuori il sistema sanitario che loro volta esprimono valori e preferenze anche contrastanti il metodo scelto dal cnec e adottato anche dall agenzia italiana del farmaco per le valutazioni di propria competenza per la produzione di linee guida il metodo grade grading recommendations assessment development evaluation che costituisce oggi la principale cornice riferimento per la valutazione di affidabilit delle prove scientifiche e per la formulazione di raccomandazioni cliniche basate sulle evidenze sanit viene utilizzato da pi di organizzazioni tutto il mondo comprendenti anche l organizzazione mondiale della sanit e il national institute health care excellence www gradeworkinggroup org il grade assicura standardizzazione e trasparenza della procedura con cui viene valutata la qualit delle prove disponibili e la forza delle raccomandazioni per la produzione di linee guida favorendo una valutazione integrata della qualit metodologica delle prove disponibili con altri aspetti che devono essere considerati per sviluppare e stabilire la forza di una raccomandazione mediante cosiddetti evidence decision framework quali priorit della problematica trattata e impatto sanitario variabilit costi benefici e rischi attesi valori e preferenze dei pazienti costoefficacia accettabilit fattibilit ed equit il grade offre un approccio flessibile e pragmatico che pu essere applicato sia alla produzione di una linea guida ex novo che adattamento di linee guida gi esistenti per le quali si applicano gli schemi di grade adolopment calibrati su un determinato contesto culturale e organizzativo il panel di esperti gruppi di lavoro multidisciplinari e multistakeholder che sistematicamente devono coinvolgere anche utenti cittadini definisce chiaramente la domanda di ricerca il protocollo condiviso secondo l acronimo pico patient intervention comparator outcome per l analisi della qualit delle prove di evidenza ed esprimere giudizi sui diversi criteri di valutazione necessari alla formulazione e valutazione della forza delle raccomandazioni mediante una gestione trasparente e una particolare attenzione alla disclosure e alla gestione dei conflitti di interesse dei membri dei panel fortemente ancorata mondo reale con il processo di evidence decision il grade si pone l obiettivo di ordinare per gradi la forza delle raccomandazioni espresse dai panel di esperti modo da offrire strumenti interpretativi e decisionali per pazienti utenti clinici e decisori sanitari la rappresentativit e il coinvolgimento con modalit strutturate di tutte le figure competenti e rilevanti per quesiti e sulle raccomandazioni oggetto costituisce un aspetto fondamentale di qualit e credibilit della linea guida accanto alla chiara affinit tra metodo grade e logiche epidemiologiche e di centralit di un approccio multidimensionale multidisciplinare e inter professionale che caratterizza il processo decisionale sanit pubblica interessante evidenziare l opportunit della promozione dell applicazione del grade per gli igienisti sia nella veste di proponenti esperti per gli ambiti tecnico scientifici di propria competenza e destinatari professionali delle raccomandazioni che qualit di manager e decisori che possono essere coinvolti nei panel anche su pratiche di non esclusiva pertinenza della sanit pubblica nonch naturalmente di metodologi parte dei team di revisione della letteratura e supporto dell utilizzo del metodo stesso che richiede una specifica formazione e competenza gli indirizzi sulle lg comprendono anche la fase di implementazione attinente come partire dalle raccomandazioni prodotte e diffuse si riesce ad incidere sui comportamenti professionali ovvero colmare il gap tra ricerca e pratica professionale questo richiede leadership e facilitazione del giusto mix di interventi preferibilmente multifattoriali di supporto cambiamento audit feedback interventi formativi mirati processi di consenso locali uso di strumenti di comunicazione ecc calibrati su ostacoli e fattori favorenti l adozione delle linee guida l implementazione di lg promuove la gestione e la condivisione di informazioni conoscenze e pratiche che favoriscono un approccio trasversale rispetto alle funzioni e ai team di lavoro che promuove l integrazione sia interno che con l esterno delle organizzazioni sanitarie e pu assicurare processi decisionali pi affidabili ed efficienti la coerenza tra raccomandazioni per l ottimizzazione dell efficacia e altre dimensioni della qualit dell intervento sanitario quali sicurezza accessibilit ed equit con le esigenze di efficienza e razionalit organizzativa dei servizi configura un importante ancoraggio delle lg paradigma emergente del valore sanit costruire una sanit basata sul valore implica una chiara analisi del profilo di efficacia degli interventi sanitari e la disponibilit di robusti strumenti valutativi e infrastrutture digitali di supporto alla misurazione accurata e tempestiva dei dati epidemiologici della popolazione da trasformare informazioni cliniche rilevanti per integrare e analizzare tutti passaggi e risultati ottenuti del ciclo di assistenza oggetto e da correlare costantemente con costi sostenuti dal sistema sanitario massimizzare il valore ovvero gli esiti prodotti relazione alle risorse disposizione per gli individui e le popolazioni presuppone l adozione di criteri di finanziamento e di gestione delle risorse umane e organizzative e soluzioni tecnologiche che facilitino la costruzione di reti e percorsi da coniugare con la capacit di tradurre risultati della ricerca sanitarium e le best practice raccomandazioni altro canto la diffusione di pratiche sicure efficaci e appropriate consente di concorrere maniera determinante uniformit di tassonomia modelli e comportamenti profes sionali contesti decisionali affini ovvero di contribuire standardizzare l operativit dei servizi aspetto quest ultimo rilevante nel contesto della sanit pubblica italiana e delle sue articolazioni operative territoriali l adozione di linee guida ovviamente presenta anche aspetti di criticit legati effettiva traduzione dei risultati della ricerca e dell innovazione comportamenti professionali diffusi e virtuoso anche adeguatezza delle lg e dei correlati processi decisionali di fronte quesiti target di popolazione per loro natura complessi come quelli che si incontrano per esempio nel produrre indirizzi che siano effettivamente rispondenti alle esigenze di prevenzione e personalizzazione dell assistenza del paziente complesso ci vanno aggiunte alcune difficolt organizzative e professionali che connotano l odierna fase di avvio della concreta applicazione del metodo grade allo sviluppo delle raccomandazioni per la pratica clinica proposto nel nuovo sistema nazionale linee guida per esempio rispetto alla sanit pubblica pur esistendo oggi molte lg autorevoli e di diffusa applicazione queste spesso risultano essere datate e realizzate con meccanismi di consenso e formulazione delle raccomandazioni di tipo tradizionale rendendo dunque necessari aggiornamenti e adattamenti secondo le menzionate modalit di lavoro proposte livello nazionale e internazionale per produrre linee guida di alta qualit per operare nel quadro della nuova cornice metodologica sulle lg ai medici e agli altri professionisti sanitari ai manager e ai policy maker della sanit mondo accademico e alle societ scientifiche richiesto un investimento prioritario nella gestione di conoscenze fondate su un approccio scientifico strutturato e trasparente alla definizione dell efficacia e dell appropriatezza degli interventi medici questo contesto nazionale per gli igienisti collaborazione con tutti gli attori della sanit pubblica strategico un impegno permanente sulla tematica delle linee guida da sostenere anche mediante azioni di formazione condivisione di conoscenza e di comunicazione valorizzare l applicazione critica di strumenti per governare processi decisionali secondo logiche di partecipazione e fiducia reciproca tra gli stakeholder fondamentale per il perseguimento degli obiettivi di

la persona un modello dove la salute come un continuum tra salute e malattia equilibrio gi richiamato seppilli interno del quale ogni individuo si pu collocare responsabilmente attivando risorse ed opportunit per favorire lo spostamento verso il polo salute questo modello il ssn e l intero governo della cosa pubblica sono chiamati un lavoro di supporto ai singoli componenti della comunit stimolandoli ad un ruolo attivo e mettendo loro disposizione risorse alle quali attingere nel momento del bisogno per poi riprendere il proprio percorso di vita le azioni restano quelle della carta di ottawa politiche di salute ambienti favorevoli partecipazione attiva delle comunit e dei singoli ri orientamento dei servizi sanitari questo modello richiede iniziative organiche coerenti e sinergiche ed una presa di posizione da parte dei singoli pro attiva cosciente questo stato determinato ancora da antonovsky dal senso di coerenza orientamento generale verso il mondo e verso il futuro basato su tre dimensioni cognitiva comprensione della realt circostante motivazionale elaborazione del proprio orizzonte di vita e comportamentale capacit di plasmare le difficolt singoli devono essere educati questo ruolo possibile solo se questo processo inizia gi nei primo anni di vita famiglia e nelle strutture formative la scuola come micro cosmo dove sperimentare un luogo protetto esperienza di partecipazione e condivisione anche nella creazione del proprio ambiente di apprendimento da replicare poi nella comunit e sul luogo di lavoro tutto ci funziona solo ricollocando centro dell intero sistema paese la persona nella sua interezza membro di una collettivit di individui responsabili innescando un processo virtuoso cui sia possibile rinforzare le risorse generali di resistenza e dare un senso alle nostre esperienze di vita dovunque esercitate contu dipartimento scienze mediche e sanit pubblica universit di cagliari la promozione della salute si sviluppata come movimento scientifico professionale culturale sociale e politico partire dalla carta di ottawa redatta nel risposta alle aspettative per un nuovo movimento di sanit pubblica di stimolo azione favore della salute per tutti la carta di ottawa guarda alla salute una visione di globalit della persona e dell ambiente cui convive una pluralit di interessi e obiettivi individuali e sociali la carta afferma la necessit di andare oltre la promozione di stili di vita sani verso un idea globale di benessere favorendo condizioni di vita e di lavoro sicure stimolanti soddisfacenti e gradevoli per conseguire uno stato di completo benessere fisico mentale e sociale l individuo e la comunit devono essere grado di identificare e realizzare le proprie aspirazioni di soddisfare propri bisogni di modificare l ambiente di adattarvisi la salute non importante tanto se stessa perch e se contribuisce promuovere una vita piena e soddisfacente armonia coi propri valori e interessi quella vita buona che aristotele definisce eudaimonia ponendola come fine ultimo dell esistenza questa sede si propone una lettura della carta di ottawa basata sulle tre strategie fondamentali nel testo originale enabling mediating advocating da applicare alle cinque aree azione chiave la strategia enabling pu essere definita dal termine empowerment un processo sociale culturale psicologico e politico con cui individui e gruppi sociali acquisiscono la capacit di esprimere propri bisogni progettare strategie per partecipare ai processi decisionali e sviluppare azioni politiche sociali e culturali per rispondere ai bisogni individuati nel suo significato pi ampio e radicale riguarda la lotta oppressione e ingiustizia mediante la redistribuzione del potere disuguale questa strategia si esplica soprattutto nell azione sviluppare le capacit personali che oggi pu essere meglio definita come sviluppare literacy e life skill asset la strategia di advocacy stretta relazione con l azione politica e si esplica soprattutto nelle azioni creare ambienti favorevoli costruire politiche di salute riorientare servizi sanitari che pu essere sintetizzata come costruire politiche e ambienti salutogeni la strategia mediating pu essere definita come partnership e si esplica soprattutto nell azione rafforzare l azione comunitaria pi semplicemente azione comunitaria stretta connessione col concetto di coesione sociale le tre strategie possono essere illustrate utilizzando un racconto inviato da gramsci figlio un bambino dorme c un bricco di latte pronto per il suo risveglio un topo si beve il latte il bambino non avendo il latte strilla e la mamma strilla il topo corre dalla capra per avere del latte la capra gli dar il latte se avr l erba da mangiare il topo va dalla campagna per l erba e la campagna arida vuole acqua il topo va dalla fontana la fontana stata rovinata dalla guerra e l acqua si disperde vuole il mastro muratore che la riatti il topo va dal mastro muratore vuole le pietre il topo va dalla montagna e avviene un sublime dialogo tra il topo e la montagna che stata disboscata dagli speculatori e mostra dappertutto le sue os senza terra il topo racconta tutta la storia e promette che il bambino cresciuto ripianter pini querce castagni cos la montagna le pietre e il bimbo ha tanto latte che si lava anche col latte cresce pianta gli alberi tutto muta spariscono le os della montagna sotto nuovo humus la precipitazione atmosferica ridiventa regolare perch gli alberi trattengono vapori e impediscono ai torrenti di devastare la pianura l azione di promozione della salute condotta del topo concretizza le tre strategie sopra delineate il topo costruisce attraverso un sublime dialogo di advocacy politiche e ambienti salutogeni affrontando bisogni attraverso un piano globale che sviluppa le risorse asset esistenti se la montagna dar le pietre il bambino pianter alberi spariranno le os della montagna sotto nuovo humus la precipitazione atmosferica ridiventer regolare perch gli alberi tratterranno vapori e impediranno ai torrenti di devastare la pianura la strategia implica empowerment per tutti gli stakeholder la fontana ricostruita dal mastro muratore utilizzando le pietre e il campo riceve l acqua con cui pu produrre l erba che consentir alla capra di fornire latte bambino che potr vivere diventare adulto e piantare alberi ognuno diventa pi forte di prima libero e capace di utilizzare propri asset una strategia di azione comunitaria e coesione sociale con un azione di mediazione cui ogni stakeholder riconosce il vantaggio di mettere comune propri asset cosa significa applicare queste strategie contesto reale come nel testo di gramsci l azione di advocacy per la costruzione di politiche e ambienti salutogeni centrale una logica di promozione della salute l obbligo fondamentale della societ trasformare il contesto fisico e sociale modo espandere il potere e le libert dei cittadini rendendoli capaci di acquisire ci che desiderano salute autonomia qualit di vita lavoro istruzione appartenenza alla comunit rispetto armonia con le proprie idee e propri valori salute e benessere dovrebbero pertanto essere promossi una logica di capability con la focalizzazione su quanto le persone sono effettivamente capaci libere di fare e di essere cio sulle capability libert potere contrasto con approcci orientati convincere costringere le persone ad adottare stili di vita sani definiti da esperti con un approccio top cittadini maturi e competenti hanno il diritto di comportarsi come desiderano finch il loro comportamento non danneggi altri l ambiente consideriamo titolo di esempio il movimento e l attivit fisica come promossi dalla carta di toronto una chiamata azione ed uno strumento di advocacy per offrire tutti opportunit sostenibili di adottare uno stile di vita attivo attraverso la costruzione di politiche e ambienti salutogeni riaffermato sulla base di solide evidenze che l attivit fisica promuove il benessere la salute fisica e quella mentale previene le malattie migliora le relazioni sociali e la qualit della vita benefici economici e contribuisce alla sostenibilit ambientale la priorit data ad azioni che creino opportunit nei diversi ambiti della vita quotidiana progetti urbanistici basati sulle evidenze che sostengono gli spostamenti piedi l uso della bicicletta e l attivit fisica nel tempo libero progetti urbanistici che forniscono opportunit per fare sport per trascorrere il tempo libero e per fare attivit fisica aumentando l accesso agli spazi pubblici dove le persone di tutte l e con qualsiasi abilit possono mantenersi fisicamente attive contesti sia urbani che extra urbani politiche e servizi di trasporto che diano priorit e incentivi per muoversi piedi andare bicicletta usare il sistema di trasporto pubblico incentivi per modalit attive di spostamento da e per il posto di lavoro per l uso dei mezzi pubblici piuttosto dell auto privata infrastrutture per attivit ricreative adatte tutte le opportunit per soggetti con disabilit di essere fisicamente attivi per esemplificare si pu affermare che una societ che ritiene che muoversi bicicletta favorisca salute e ambiente e che pertanto pi persone dovrebbero muoversi bicicletta deve innanzitutto promuovere le libert capability che consentono ciascun cittadino se lo desidera di muoversi bicicletta cio disporre della bicicletta propriet noleggio bike sharing essere capace di guidare la bicicletta abilit fisica abilit tecnica disporre di percorsi sicuri pianificazione urbana disporre di tempo possibilit di spostarsi nella vita quotidiana tempo libero una convinta coerente e persistente azione politica pu produrre cambiamenti importanti secondo il rapporto euromobility cagliari che nel era posto tra le principali citt italiane tutti capoluoghi di regione pi capoluoghi di provincia con oltre abitanti per mobilit sostenibile passata posto tra gli indicatori il tasso di incidenti di sotto della medium nazionale la buona qualit dell aria l aumento dei passeggeri sui bus la quarta posizione per offerta di trasporto pubblico locale la prima per il car sharing convenzionale nel rapporto tra abitanti e numero di auto condivisione disposizione la crescita dei chilometri di piste ciclabili e del servizio di bike sharing l avvio della redazione del piano urbano della mobilit sostenibile pums non stato considerato nel rapporto l indicatore delle aree pedonali che nell edizione del vedeva cagliari seconda dopo venezia aree pedonali ulteriormente aumentate nel corso dell ultimo anno evidente come queste politiche non possano essere circoscritte ambito sanitario siano il risultato di un cambiamento complessivo del modello sociale che ha conseguenze sul sistema economico e sulle relazioni di potere e non pu quindi essere politicamente neutro implicando un dialogo uno scontro tra diverse visioni sulle priorit della societ la costruzione di politiche e ambienti salutogeni un percorso che mira rendere facile e naturale la scelta salutogena promuovendo una logica di equit per ognuno una vita piena e soddisfacente armonia coi propri valori e interessi necessario un percorso decisionale partecipativo che inglobi valori e prospettive alternative e riconosca l esistenza di obiettivi diversa volta competizione tra loro che devono essere conciliati le proteste dei gilet gialli francesi contro l aumento dei prezzi dei carburanti sono un esempio di come politiche motivate da obiettivi di salute possano se imposte dall alto senza una valutazione sull impatto globale sul benessere anche percepito di comunit e singoli possano generare tensioni sociali fino loro fallimento fino pochi decenni fa il concetto di salute era considerato come assenza di malattia e la risposta sanitarium organizzata consisteva esclusivamente nel garantire cure ospedaliere la salute oggi va colta tutta la sua complessit un valore universale fondamentale una risorsa per la vita quotidiana di cui prendersi cura dall inizio fino suo termine con un impegno mantenerla e promuoverla dell intera societ e non solo dell ambito sanitario noto infatti che dalla sanit dipende solo il della salute di una comunit dai fattori socio economici e dagli stili di vita il dalle condizioni dell ambiente il e dall eredit genetica il la sanit ospedalocentrica sempre pi incapace di sostenere il peso delle malattie cronico degenerative oggi prevalenti ed crescita che trovano risposta sanitarium appropriata nello sviluppo delle cure primarie territoriali e nella prevenzione garantendo continuit di cura e personalizzazione dell assistenza il servizio sanitario nazionale nato anni fa aveva gi incluso nei propri principi e obiettivi talus concetti la traduzione pratica nel sistema risulta ancora incompleta mettendo rischio la sua stessa sopravvivenza secondo dati dell oms dei decessi il della perdita di anni di vita buona salute e il delle spese sanitarie europa sono causati da alcune patologie malattie cardiovascolari tumori diabete mellito malattie respiratorie croniche problemi di salute mentale e disturbi muscoloscheletrici che hanno comune fattori di rischio modificabili quali il fumo di tabacco l obesit e sovrappeso l abuso di alcol lo scarso consumo di frutta e verdura la sedentariet l eccesso di grassi nel sangue e l ipertensione arteriosa gli ultimi dati nazionali del sistema di sorveglianza passi riportano che la maggior parte degli italiani sedentaria il parzialmente attivo mentre solo il risultano essere quelli che effettuano una adeguata attivit motoria inoltre quattro adulti su dieci risultano eccesso ponderale sovrappeso bmi fra e e obeso bmi e solo un italiano su consuma le cinque porzioni di frutta e verdura giorno raccomandate un italiano su quattro fumatore mentre il degli italiani dichiara di aver smesso di fumare da pi di sei mesi per quanto riguarda l alcol il degli italiani consuma bevande alcoliche e il riferisce un consumo abituale elevato poich dunque la maggior parte delle patologie presenti oggi nella nostra societ dipende prevalentemente da fattori di rischio modificabili vanno dati ai cittadini gli strumenti per controllare il proprio stato di salute un contesto che favorisca le scelte sane efficientismo lotta sprechi e corruzione non sono sufficienti fronteggiare l aumento delle patologie croniche ed il costo della innovazione farmacologica e tecnica un contesto di consumismo sanitario che invece necessitano di un cambiamento di paradigma culturale e organizzativo la promozione della salute pu costituire la cornice teorica e pratica efficace per tale cambiamento infatti secondo l health education glossary la promozione della salute un processo sociale e politico diretto non solo rafforzare le abilit e le capacit degli individui anche una azione comunitaria e culturale per il cambiamento sociale ambientale ed economico per il miglioramento delle condizioni di salute del singolo e della collettivit la valutazione del rischio sanitario associato fattori di interesse nutrizionale e tossicologico risk assessment rappresenta un ambito di grande interesse per la popolazione generale la comunit scientifica e gli operatori di sanit pubblica tale processo mira definire adeguate misure ed indicazioni di sicurezza alimentare ambientale e occupazionale e favorire un appropriata comunicazione del rischio ed efficaci interventi di medicina preventiva alla valutazione dei rischi sanitari attribuibili ai diversi fattori di tipo chimico e fisico presenti negli alimenti e negli ambienti di vita e di lavoro fattori ambientali senso lato contribuiscono da un lato singoli ricercatori attraverso loro lavori originali di ricerca meta analisi dall altro gli enti e le istituzioni specificatamente deputati processo di risk assessment quali nello specifico per l unione europea la european food safety authority efsa con sede nel nostro paese parma la valutazione del rischio attribuibile ai fattori ambientali e nutrizionali prevede diverse fasi metodologiche tre delle quali sono state soggette profonde innovazioni nel corso degli ultimi anni e sono di seguito brevemente analizzate l identificazione e la valutazione metodologica della letteratura epidemiologica l analisi ed interpretazione dei risultati di tale letteratura la formulazione di valutazioni finali condivise superando eventuali differenze di opinione tra gli esperti se da una parte la tutela della salute dei lavoratori si concentra opportunamente sulla prevenzione dei rischi specifici legati alle professioni e mansioni negli ambienti di lavoro ed finalizzata prevenire infortuni e malattie professionali non sono mancate fin dagli anni esperienze nelle quali sono stati proposti interventi di prevenzione sul personale di pi largo spettro che includevano piani di attivit fisica programmi di cessazione del fumo di gestione dello stress di educazione nutrizionale nello scorso decennio si fatta strada diverse organizzazioni l idea che una promozione olistica del wellness aziendale potesse anche avere un impatto positivo sui livelli di produttivit dei lavoratori coinvolti l ambiente lavorativo di grandi aziende pu fornire numerosi strumenti momenti e risorse utilizzabili per aumentare la coscienza nei lavoratori e nel loro network sociale del possibile ruolo preventivo dell attivit motoria e sportiva e motivarne la pratica costante e corretta programmi finalizzati benessere dei lavoratori devono fin dalla loro progettazione coinvolgere tutte le parti interessate datori di lavoro lavoratori medici del lavoro e altri operatori sanitari presenti interno dell azienda e sindacati molti paesi si consolidata l idea che la salute e il benessere di chi opera una grande azienda siano parte integrante del core business e non solo un aspetto che riguarda il dipartimento risorse umane la responsabilit sociale dell azienda conradie pronk un articolo del hanno proposto tre principi base da considerare per progettare ed implementare programmi di attivit motoria interno delle aziende produttive organizzare attivit fisiche interno di un sistema che valorizzi le relazioni interpersonali dei soggetti e il loro ambente di lavoro dare priorit ad interventi per quali esistano prove scientifiche di efficacia integrare gli specifici interventi di promozione dell attivit fisica con coerenti buone pratiche di prevenzione globale negli ambienti di lavoro tra le numerosissime raccomandazioni proposte da questi stessi autori quali buone pratiche per la promozione dell attivit fisica ambito aziendale vale la pena di ricordare particolare la necessit di costruire programmi tagliati su misura tailored per lo specifico ambito lavorativa l opportunit di iniziare da piccoli programmi che potranno poi estendersi gradualmente quanti nell azienda intendano partecipare e l importanza di accompagnare la proposta di attivit fisica con adeguate misure e analisi degli stati dei partecipanti e delle variazioni conseguenti alla partecipazione promuovere la salute attraverso l attivit motoria nella popolazione di tutte le fasce di uno degli obiettivi prioritari dell organizzazione mondiale della sanit oms il piano azione globale sull attivit fisica per gli anni dell oms mira ridurre del l inattivit fisica negli adolescenti e negli adulti nel stabilendo gli obiettivi strategici da conseguire per mezzo di azioni politiche il piano nazionale della prevenzione prorogato ha tra gli obiettivi principali la promozione dell attivit motoria con il fine di incrementare del soggetti adulti e del gli fisicamente attivi nel decreto del presidente del consiglio dei ministri dpcm del gennaio sui nuovi livelli essenziali di assistenza lea sono previsti l attivazione di programmi strutturati di attivit motoria per soggetti rischio e l offerta di counselling individuale per la promozione dell attivit motoria sede di conferenza stato regioni il marzo sono state approvate le linee di indirizzo sull attivit fisica per le differenti fasce e con riferimento situazioni fisiologiche e fisiopatologiche e sottogruppi specifici di popolazione stilate da un tavolo tecnico presso la direzione generale della prevenzione sanitarium del ministero della salute nelle linee di indirizzo esplicitato il ruolo decisivo che l attivit motoria svolge per accrescere la salute nella popolazione generale e l importanza della sua pratica quotidiana l italia uno dei paesi pi sedentari europa il della popolazione dichiara di non praticare attivit motoria rispetto alla medium europea del dati eurobarometro l attivit motoria fondamentale per il benessere fisico psichico e sociale dei cittadini e delle loro comunit l attivit motoria oltre ad avere un ruolo protettivo nella prevenzione di molte patologie croniche svolge come dimostrano numerosi e importanti studi scientifici un ruolo di promozione della salute nella popolazione generale l attivit motoria infatti si dimostrata estremamente efficace nel migliorare l efficienza cardiovascolare nel mantenere una normale pressione arteriosa sul metabolismo glucidico e lipidico sul sovrappeso sulla obesit sulla osteoporosi sui tumori particolare quello del seno e del colon nel migliorare il tono dell umore e nel ridurre gli stati depressivi e ansiosi per diminuire la mortalit cardiovascolare basta una attivit motoria sia negli uomini che nelle donne indipendentemente dall che comporti un semplice dispendio energetico di kcal minuto nelle persone attive l biologica di anni inferiore rispetto ad un soggetto sedentario di pari l attivit motoria e sportiva inoltre un fattore di coesione sociale generando relazioni positive negli ultimi venti anni italia abbiamo assistito diversi episodi di emergenze causate da incidenti catastrofi naturali come terremoti e inondazioni ed epidemie ognuno di questi eventi porta con oltre ai danni materiali e alle persone nell immediato anche una conseguente emergenza sanitarium quanto si creano situazioni critiche che possono incidere sulla salute umana anche distanza di tempo dal momento dell evento italia la protezione civile occupa un posto di primaria importanza per la gestione ed il coordinamento dei primo soccorsi e nella organizzazione delle risorse e del personale tale organizzazione porta ad una conseguente necessit di personale specializzato ed addestrato ad agire velocemente nelle situazioni pi critiche tenendo per conto del fatto che il personale allertato per la maggior parte volontario deve essere chiaro che anche interno del sistema sanitario necessario che professionisti siano comunque formati e preparati ad affrontare situazioni critiche e siano preparati coordinarsi con le forze esterne chiamate causa nella gestione considerando la difficolt nel prevedere la maggior parte di questi eventi evidente che ci debba essere monte una preparazione pi meno specifica del personale e che si debba agire ambito preventivo anche con una fase di preparazione e di pianificazione della risposta del sistema sanitario durante e dopo l emergenza il modello organizzativo degli screening oncologici dell azienda usl di bologna un sistema ben strutturato cui l estensione della popolazione invitata ad eseguire test si attesta intorno con periodiche criticit rilevate nell ambito dello screening mammografico l adesione ai tre test di screening invece si rivela meno virtuosa rispetto alla regione emilia romagna particolare per lo screening del tumore della cervice uterina questo contesto progetti volti miglioramento dell adesione dovrebbero coinvolgere pi aspetti del rapporto strutturacittadino con l obiettivo di accrescere la fiducia e la fidelizzazione nel programma rimangono infatti ampi spazi intervento per quanto riguarda la partecipazione di quelle fasce di popolazione che per specifiche condizioni di fragilit sociale di salute hanno una scarsa percezione dell importanza della prevenzione con l obiettivo di raggiungere adeguatamente queste persone quindi necessario progettare interventi specifici volti ad agire sui determinanti della salute con adeguata attenzione rivolta alle problematiche di comunicazione pertanto si ritenuto interessante mostrare le strategie di miglioramento messe atto dal programma di screening dell azienda usl di bologna le malattie croniche rappresentano una delle principali sfide della sanit pubblica patologie cardiovascolari polmonari oncologiche sono infatti continuum evoluzione tutta europa con rilevanti ripercussioni sul contesto sociale ed economico dei singoli paesi tuttavia le evidenze epidemiologiche raccolte negli ultimi anni mostrano una stretta correlazione tra l attuale burden disease e molti fattori di rischio prevenibili associati agli stili di vita primis fumo di sigaretta scorrette abitudini alimentari inattivit fisica e l abuso di alcol la promozione di stili di vita salutari diventata pertanto una priorit nelle strategie internazionali per migliorare la salute best buy indicati dall oms ovvero specifiche e costo efficaci policy finalizzate alla riduzione del carico di malattia legato alle malattie croniche rappresentano il punto di svolta per il raggiungimento dell obiettivo dei sustainable development goals attraverso il quale governi di tutto il mondo si sono impegnati per ridurre la mortalit prematura per malattie croniche di un terzo nel per essere efficaci queste politiche di sanit pubblica hanno bisogno di adeguate azioni comunicative che siano grado di raggiungere efficacemente il target aumentandone le conoscenze e competenze sugli argomenti di salute soprattutto determinando un cambiamento comportamentale grado di impattare significativamente sugli esiti di salute varie strategie sono state utilizzate come strumenti delle campagne di promozione della salute per migliorare gli esiti di salute specifici target dai pi tradizionali mass medium come tv radio giornali pubblicit ai pi recenti strumenti come social network le app e dispositivi messi disposizione dell evoluzione tecnologica eppure nonostante il considerevole impegno terminus di risorse umane e finanziare necessarie per mettere atto le azioni comunicative la loro efficacia e soprattutto costo efficacia varia notevolmente ed difficile da misurare infatti le analisi di costo efficacia non frequenti negli studi scientifici sono spesso gravate da una profonda variabilit nei metodi utilizzati con conseguenti problemi terminus di trasparenza comparabilit e generalizzabilit considerando l esistenza di due recenti revisioni sistematiche sul tema che coprono studi condotti tra il ed il questa revisione di letteratura frutto del lavoro del gdl della siti comunicazione per la sanit pubblica si propone di fornire una quadro aggiornato nell ambito della valutazione di efficacia delle azioni comunicative di sanit pubblica uno studio randomizzato ha dimostrato che il vaccino combinato gsk contro morbillo parotite rosolia varicella mmrv somministrato due dosi durante il secondo anno di vita protegge efficacemente contro la varicella durante anni post vaccinazione presentiamo dati relativi mantenimento della efficacia vaccinale e della immunogenicit anni post vaccinazione nei bambino arruolati italia confrontati ai dati generali dello studio l infezione da hpv ampiamente riconosciuta come responsabile dello sviluppo di numerose patologie tra cui il cancro della cervice uterina nonostante la disponibilit della vaccinazione contro diversi sierotipi di hpv renda possibile attuare una efficace prevenzione primaria di talus patologie questa dipende certamente dai livelli di aderenza della popolazione target l obiettivo di questo lavoro ha riguardato pertanto l identificazione e valutazione di strategie volta ad aumentare le coperture vaccinali tra gli adolescenti che rappresentano il target primario della campagna vaccinale italia la vaccinazione rappresenta ad oggi uno degli strumenti di prevenzione primaria utilizzato per la lotta delle malattie infettive prevenibili da vaccino durante lo svolgimento della seduta vaccinale il personale sanitario addetto ha il compito di informare l utenza sulle possibili vaccinazioni indicate da calendario vaccinale e proporre eventuali vaccinazioni seconda delle esigenze dell utente e del suo stato di salute l esperienza lavorativa del personale sanitario che ha come mission la prevenzione e il controllo della diffusione di malattie infettive tramite vaccinazione ha permesso di rilevare una criticit legata alla mancanza di uno strumento valido e aggiornato che possa essere da guida allo stesso sulla co somministrazione di pi vaccinazioni nella stessa giornata globalmente ogni anno la patologia influenzale colpisce tra il e il della popolazione adulta nei bambino e casi pi gravi tra e milioni di casi possono arrivare decesso nel dei casi soprattutto nei soggetti pi fragili come bambino di inferiore ai anni gli anziani e malati cronici questo contesto diventa cruciale il ruolo giocato dai professionisti sanitari ps che rappresentano anche un modello di comportamento per pazienti e cittadini lo scopo del presente studio stato quello di valutare attraverso una analisi quantitativa della letteratura disponibile le attitudini dei ps nei confronti di politiche obbligatorie di vaccinazione antinfluenzale nonostante la prematurit sia una condizione ad alto rischio per le malattie infettive e l organizzazione mondiale della sanit raccomandi le vaccinazioni per neonati prematuri secondo le stesse modalit per neonati termine la copertura vaccinale e la tempestivit delle vaccinazioni questa popolazione ancora inferiore rispetto alla popolazione generale pg la vaccinazione contro la pertosse gravidanza vpg con il vaccino contenuto antigenico ridotto difterite tetano pertosse acellulare dtpa riduce il rischio di malattia nei neonati sono stati condotti due studi clinici collegati con l obiettivo di valutare la sicurezza e l immunogenicit della vpg misurare il trasferimento degli anticorpi neonato e l effetto sulla risposta del neonato alla propria vaccinazione italia la vaccinazione antinfluenzale nella popolazione pediatrica non stata fino ad oggi attivamente proposta almeno fino alla stagione il vaccino bench indicato partire dai mesi di vita erogabile nei bambino sani solo pagamento nonostante questa fascia di sia la pi importante dal punto di vista epidemiologico nella trasmissione dell infezione obiettivo dello studio stimare una coorte di bambino non ospedalizzati nel corso di stagioni influenzali post pandemiche l efficacia della vaccinazione antinfluenzale relazione ai ceppi circolanti le microplastiche hanno assunto una notevole importanza come contaminanti e data la loro presenza ubiquitaria esse rappresentano una minaccia sia per l ambiente che per la salute umana ortaggi e frutta non sono mai stati studiati tal riguardo poich non esisteva un metodo analitico che ne permetteva la corretta determinazione numerica nelle frazioni pi piccole e dunque suscettibili di compartimentalizzazione tissutale scopo del nostro studio era indagare attraverso un nuovo metodo brevettato la presenza di microplastiche ortaggi e frutta acquistate da tre siti grande distribuzione prodotti km zero e mercatini rionali gli ftalati potenziali endocrine disruptors comunemente addizionati alle materie plastiche si ritrovano numerosi prodotti di largo consumo quali involucri alimentari giochi cosmetici e prodotti per l igiene personale le conoscenze sui livelli di esposizione prenatale e soprattutto postnatale ftalati dei neonati sono tuttavia molto limitate questo studio ha l obiettivo di valutare attraverso il biomonitoraggio urinario l esposizione prenatale e postnatale ftalati neonati della provincia di modena e di indagare il ruolo effetto di questa esposizione sull accrescimento corporeo sui livelli ormonali e sullo sviluppo neuro cognitivo nei primo due anni di vita il laboratorio b labnet una struttura operativa che supporta e integra le attivit di ricerca sui temi dell ambiente della salute e della sostenibilit svolte da diversi gruppi dell ateneo di brescia gli scopi del laboratorio sono favorire lo studio dei temi ambientali promuovere l interdisciplinariet della ricerca e rafforzare le interazioni con il territorio la rilevazione di biomarcatori di effetto biologico precoce potrebbe essere utile ad identificare rischi derivanti dall esposizione sostanze tossiche e gestire l inquinamento atmosferico preventivamente rispetto ai danni potenziali sulla salute umana l obiettivo dello studio stato quello di determinare la frequenza di micronuclei mn nelle cellule della mucosa buccale di bambino residenti nelle citt di brindisi e torchiarolo associata esposizione ad inquinanti atmosferici ed fattori individuali e comportamentali queste citt sono localizzate un area ad alto livello di inquinamento atmosferico causato da impianti industriali ad alto impatto ambientale area impattata risultati sono stati comparati con quelli riscontrati un area del salento senza evidenti impatti ambientali area controllo le macroalghe sono una fonte importante di metaboliti secondari con propriet antibatteriche antifungine antitumorali e antinfiammatorie nel progetto remedia life finanziato dalla comunit europea si sta utilizzando per la prima volta europa la modalit di acquacoltura multitrofica integrata imta nella quale accanto allevamento dei pesci vi l allevamento

degli operatori sanitari riveste un importanza non trascurabile nell accettazione dei vaccini il presente studio indaga il ruolo degli operatori sotto la duplice veste di genitori e professionisti sanitari l obiettivo dello studio evidenziare le posizioni assunte tema di vaccinazioni dai genitori che lavorano ambito sanitario ed analizzare come genitori vaccinatori esitanti e non vaccinatori ricorrono alle figure sanitarie quali fonti di informazione riguardo ai vaccini ogni anno nel mondo la gastroenterite da rotavirus causa circa mezzo milione di decessi nei bambino sotto anni negli stati uniti contesto assimilabile quello italiano le morti associate rotavirus colpiscono soprattutto bambino tra e mesi allo stato attuale tuttavia si stima che la vaccinazione potrebbe prevenire

rarely considered psychological characteristic parent affect decision making study aim filling gap exploring relationship parent emotional competence attitude towards vaccine la diagnosi di comunit condotta nel nei quartieri della citt di taranto caratterizzati da basso livelli di coperture vaccinali e finalizzata alla comprensione dei determinanti di scarsa adesione ai programmi vaccinali ha evidenziato notevoli disuguaglianze terminus di accessibilit e informazione vaccinale pertanto stato necessario un riorientamento dell offerta di salute l organizzazione di specifiche campagne di promozione della salute e l apertura di un ambulatorio vaccinale nel quartiere con maggiori criticit l obiettivo dello studio valutare se le azioni adottate talus contesti abbiano determinato un abbattimento delle barriere infrastrutturali e comunicative con raggiungimento di livelli di coperture vaccinali pi alti rispetto quelli fino ad allora rilevati internet e social medium tra cui twitter hanno fornito nuove piattaforme di diffusione rapida di informazioni non sempre adeguatamente supportate da evidenze scientifiche questo propone nuove sfide per la sanit pubblica studiare il funzionamento dei social network per imparare comunicare efficacemente grazie alle piattaforme digitali potrebbe forse aiutare risolvere problemi di salute pubblica come l attuale esitazione vaccinale l obiettivo dello studio analizzare tweet sui vaccini pubblicati lingua italiana nel periodo delle elezioni politiche gennaio aprile per tracciarne l andamento temporale relazione fatti di cronaca significativi valutarne la provenienza geografica e identificare le tematiche pi virali il calo delle coperture vaccinali e la riemergenza di malattie infettive prevenibili pongono l attenzione sul problema dell esitazione vaccinale vaccine hesitancy vh il presente ha come obiettivo analizzare alcuni determinanti della vh con particolare riferimento health literacy e l erratum percezione del rischio di malattie prevenibili da vaccino la comunicazione del rischio un campo di studio che trova ampio impiego nella gestione di eventi epidemici nei quali l informazione diretta una collettivit la percezione del rischio coinvolge diverse dimensioni sia su un piano razionale ed oggettivo che su un piano emozionale e soggettivo molti casi esiste una discrepanza tra la percezione soggettiva del pericolo e la valutazione oggettiva caput poche parole che le persone temano eventi che non sono realt pericolosi sottostimando invece situazioni che potrebbero avere conseguenze drammatiche un articolo del ropeik e slovic hanno delineato alcuni fattori che influenzano il modo cui persone non esperte valutano un rischio come ad esempio la paura legata alla risonanza sociale del tipo di evento la possibilit di controllo e di scelta il coinvolgimento di bambino la memoria dell evento la consapevolezza del fenomeno e la possibilit di essere coinvoltiuna pletora di studi sta

attraverso l utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie prende avvio co due passi salute con le acli giugno di quest anno si conclusa la terza edizione del progetto nel presente abstract si far riferimento semestre gennaio giugno macro obiettivo promuovere l invecchiamento attivo attraverso la sensibilizzazione sui corretti stili di vita e l utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie tre fattori su cui si interviene sono lo svolgimento di attivit fisica e mentale degli la promozione di una dieta equilibrata la promozione l utilizzo delle tecnologie per la salute nonostante la scuola rappresenti un contesto ideale per fornire ai bambino opportunit di pratica del movimento e supportarli nello sviluppo di uno stile di vita attivo il tempo che essi trascorrono posizione seduta durante l orario scolastico contribuisce ad incrementarne livelli di sedentariet numerose evidenze mostrano come l integrazione di pause attive nell orario scolastico possa essere una strategia efficace nel contrastare tale fenomeno le bevande alcoliche sono comunemente consumate tutto il mondo durante pasti di fuori sebbene il consumo di bevande alcoliche sia normalmente accettato nella nostra societ l abuso di alcol tra gli studenti un problema che non deve essere sottovalutato perch pu danneggiare la salute mentale e globale dell individuo influenzando negativamente il rendimento universitario e di conseguenza anche quello futuro professionale con ricaduta finale sulla salute dei pazienti il nostro studio si concentrato particolare sugli studenti di infermieristica dell universit di palermo dei tre anni di corso con l obiettivo di stimare la prevalenza del consumo rischio di alcol e di analizzarne fattori associati il consumo di tabacco comporta molteplici aspetti non solo sanitari anche socio culturali psicologici ed economici promuovere una cultura libera dal tabacco quindi richiede un approccio globale e multifattoriale tenendo conto della normativa vigente livello nazionale e interno dell universit sapienza di roma il dipartimento di sanit pubblica e malattie infettive ha sviluppato il progetto dipartimento senza fumo per promuovere la salute del singolo della comunit e la salvaguardia dell ambiente l obiettivo del presente studio rendere il dipartimento di sanit pubblica e malattie infettive un luogo libero dal fumo costituendo un modello di promozione della salute nel pieno rispetto della normativa vigente tutelando la salute e la sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro e di studio e assicurando il decoro nei luoghi pubblici lo studio si propone inoltre di favorire la health literacy come una delle mission universitarie e di sensibilizzare altri dipartimenti diventare luoghi liberi dal fumo nonostante l attivit fisica sia riconosciuta come uno dei principali determinanti di salute la sorveglianza passi evidenzia che il della popolazione italiana tra e anni risulta sedentario con un trend aumento negli ultimi anni e la sedentariet aumenta negli anziani raggiungendo il passi argento diventa pertanto urgente implementare strategie di promozione dell attivit fisica approfittando come raccomandato dall oms di ogni occasione favorevole considerando che per attivit fisica si intende qualsiasi movimento corporeo associato una contrazione muscolare che aumenta il dispendio di energia sopra livelli di riposo l obiettivo del progetto attiva l attesa quello di trasformare le pause di attesa della vita quotidiana e sale di attesa dei medici uffici fermata dei trasporti pubblici musei un opportunit per svolgere semplici esercizi di stretching e mobilizzazione articolare attiva previsione della proposta di tale progetto ambito termale stato somministrato come studio pilota il questionario di valutazione pre intervento presso le terme egidio cryptosporidium spp rappresenta ancora un rischio per la salute umana causa della presenza abbastanza diffusa nelle acque superficiali e della resistenza delle oocisti alle condizioni ambientali ai disinfettanti e differenti processi di trattamento una recente revisione delle epidemie trasmesse dall acqua livello mondiale ha messo evidenza che cryptosporidium spp risulta essere l agente responsabile del delle epidemie segnalate tra il e il questo contesto le informazioni sulla vitalit delle oocisti di cryptosporidium spp sono di notevole importanza nella stima del rischio per la salute umana e dell efficienza dei trattamenti di potabilizzazione pertanto lo scopo dello studio stato quello di valutare la contaminazione da oocisti di cryptosporidium spp un piccolo impianto di potabilizzazione di un paese pedemontano caratterizzato da filtrazione e trattamento uv per verificare gli eventuali rischi per la popolazione negli ultimi decenni si assistito ad un aumento nelle acque sotterranee della concentrazione di nitrati da attribuirsi principalmente utilizzo di quantit eccessive di fertilizzanti sui terreni agricoli la direttiva ue per preservare l acqua dalla contaminazione da nitrati provenienti da fonti agricole stabilisce la soglia accettabile con valore limite di mg l nel presente studio stata determinata la contami nazione da nitrati delle acque sotterranee nella puglia con particolare attenzione impatto generato da oliveti e vigneti attraverso la valutazione dell impronta idrica grigia gwf che misura la quantit di acqua necessaria per assimilare un inquinante prodotto da attivit antropiche la qualit dell aria immessa un ambiente indoor legata anche alle condizioni igieniche degli impianti aeraulici e delle sue condotte interne il particolato aero disperso pu diventare un veicolo di contaminazione microbiologica e sorgente di malattie di natura diversa infettive allergiche etc numerosi studi hanno confermato la correlazione tra qualit dell aria e salute sia ambito sanitario sia turistico ricettivo e comunitario obiettivo dello studio valutare l efficacia della disinfezione delle condotte aerauliche con microaerosolizzazione di perossido di idrogeno dopo attivit di spazzolamento meccanico e allontanamento delle polveri tramite aspirazione recenti studi hanno evidenziato che sorgenti combustibili di varia natura quali candele incensi e fumo di tabacco emettono durante l utilizzo sia sostanze che particelle fini e ultrafini potenzialmente dannose per la salute umana inoltre la qualit dell aria degli ambienti confinati pu essere notevolmente peggiorata anche da altri elettrodomestici di uso comune che vengono utilizzati anche quotidianamente negli ambienti indoor di vita e di lavoro scopo del lavoro di valutare sperimentalmente l inquinamento indoor terminus di livelli di particelle fini e ultrafini emesse durante l utilizzo di alcuni elettrodomestici e sorgenti combustibili di vario tipo nel corso del un dispositivo conosciuto come sigaretta elettronica e cig stato immesso commercio riscuotendo un enorme successo da allora le caratteristiche delle e cigs hanno subito una notevole evoluzione e dispositivi attualmente disponibili sono suddivisi quattro generazioni dai modelli base di prima e seconda generazione pi rigidi nelle prestazioni si passati ai modelli di terza e quarta generazione pi performanti pi pericolosi perch dotati di resistenze pi basse che favorendo un miglior passaggio della corrente raggiungono temperature molto pi elevate tali temperature sono responsabili della liberazione di numerose sostanze potenzialmente dannose per la salute le e cigs inoltre emettono durante l uso particelle fini e ultrafini associate ad un ulteriore rischio per la salute dei soggetti esposti passivamente effetti le e cigs vengono spesso utilizzate indoor poich la normativa vigente sul divieto di fumo non include l e cig scopo del lavoro valutare livelli di particolato particulate matter pm di diverse frazioni dimensionali emessi durante l utilizzo delle quattro generazioni di e cigs testando diverse modalit di utilizzo e differenti liquidi negli ambienti urbani l attitudine cammino degli individui condizionata da diversi fattori fra questi la percezione di sicurezza della strada sia legata traffico sia alla paura del crimine assume una particolare rilevanza condizionando le scelte degli utenti obiettivo del presente studio quello di confrontare due strumenti di rilevazione nella loro capacit di misurare la sicurezza della strada la gestione delle opere afferenti ciclo idrico integrato pu avvalersi di strumenti consolidati e spesso standardizzati nell ambito dei sistemi di gestione della qualit fine di perseguire obiettivi di efficienza e sostenibilit tecnico economica e ambientale tuttavia l individuazione della soluzione ottimale implica talvolta la necessit di confrontare e valutare innumerevoli fattori spesso tra loro contrastanti per esempio nel caso della depurazione delle acque reflue l obiettivo di rimozione degli inquinanti dalle emissioni liquide potrebbe pesare negativamente sui consumi energetici sarebbe utile disporre di uno strumento che consenta sia di definire gli obiettivi sia di misurare idonei parametri che ne descrivano il raggiungimento e infine di confrontare tra loro il valore di talus parametri avvalendosi di criteri per l attribuzione di un peso questi ultimi scopo del progetto lo sviluppo di protocolli e strumenti integrati per valutare possibili effetti di un opera segnatamente impianti di depurazione delle acque reflue sulle matrici ambientali e sulla salute umana fornendo criteri utili processo decisionale numerosi fattori possono influenzare la qualit delle acque potabili riconducibili sia alle caratteristiche della fonte di approvvigionamento e trattamento disinfettante che sistema di distribuzione alcune aree sia le acque sotterranee che le superficiali sono interessate dalla presenza di sostanze perfluoroalchiliche pfas che possono quindi raggiungere anche le acque potabili queste sostanze sono caratterizzate da una notevole persistenza nell ambiente e negli organismi viventi incluso l uomo scopo di questa ricerca valutare la tossicit e genotossicit di acqua destinata consumo umano prelevata presso diversi acquedotti del nord italia che si approvvigionano di acque di pozzo e di acque superficiali una zona caratterizzata dalla presenza di pfas mediante una batteria di saggi biologici con differenti endpoint tossicit mutagenicit genotossicit organismi diversi batteri crostacei vegetali cellule umane il compostaggio una biotecnologia espansione per il trattamento e la gestione dei rifiuti organici un processo basato sulla trasformazione biologica aerobica della biomassa organica che pu essere preceduta da una fase di digestione anaerobica il processo pu generare particolato e bioaerosol quali rappresentano un potenziale rischio per la salute dei lavoratori e delle popolazioni residenti nelle aree limitrofe agli impianti l esposizione bioaerosol pu essere associata sia patologie infettive ed allergie che patologie croniche quali copd ed asma lo scopo di questo studio caratterizzare la contaminazione da particolato sottile e bioaerosol negli impianti di compostaggio fine di valutare il rischio professionale annesso la direttiva euratom stabilisce requisiti per la tutela della salute relativamente alle sostanze radioattive presenti nelle acque destinate consumo umano recepita con lgs le regioni attraverso le asl assicurano il controllo finalizzato rispetto dei valori di parametro ovvero il valore con cui confrontare la medium annua dei valori misurati di sopra del quale obbligatorio valutare se la presenza di sostanze radioattive costituisca un

continuit delle cure sanitarie durante le epidemie di malattie vaccinoprevenibili nonostante le raccomandazioni del piano nazionale della prevenzione vaccinale la copertura vaccinale degli os italia risulta molto bassa scopo dello studio valutare lo stato vaccinale e immunitario degli os del policlinico universitario di palermo la vaccinazione anti influenzale negli operatori sanitari os rimane ancora una grossa sfida per la sanit pubblica molti paesi il valore di questa vaccinazione spesso viene sottovalutato dagli os che larga maggioranza credono che l influenza non rappresenti un serio rischio per se stessi e sottovalutano largamente il rischio per loro assistiti questo lavoro riportiamo risultati di una esperienza di offerta attiva della vaccinazione contro l influenza agli operatori vaccinali dell azienda ospedaliero universitaria pisana aoup la malattia da neisseria meningitidis un serio problema di sanit pubblica anche nei paesi sviluppati per il suo alto tasso di letalit e l elevata frequenza di sequele invalidanti che affliggono soggetti sopravvissuti fino la malattia colpisce prevalentemente bambino gli adolescenti e giovani adulti e pertanto queste categorie di soggetti dovrebbero essere il target primario delle strategie vaccinali attualmente uno dei principali problemi dei servizi sanitari dei paesi sviluppati il reperimento delle risorse economiche per implementare nuovi interventi preventivi questo contesto assumono particolare importanza le valutazioni economiche che permettono di analizzare le diverse strategie vaccinali fine di massimarne benefici l obiettivo dello studio era valutare costi e benefici della vaccinazione anti meningococco b con il vaccino ricombinante adsorbito contenente fhbp di neisseria meningitidis sierogruppo b sottofamiglia e sottofamiglia b negli adolescenti confronto con la non vaccinazione nell attuale scenario epidemiologico italiano la pertosse una malattia infettiva altamente contagiosa prevenibile da vaccinazione tuttavia la pressione immunologica esercitata dai vaccini e la mancata persistenza lungo termine della protezione immunitaria hanno determinato oltre alla riduzione dell incidenza un ruolo epidemiologico importante di adolescenti e adulti questi possono rappresentare una significativa sorgente di infezione per neonati non vaccinati vaccinati modo incompleto nei quali la pertosse pu avere un decorso clinico molto grave scopo dello studio stato quello di valutare l evoluzione epidemiologica della pertosse soprattutto carico di questo gruppo di popolazione particolarmente sensibile infezione la vaccinazione antinfluenzale rappresenta un intervento semplice ed efficace per proteggere operatori e pazienti soprattutto nei setting dove elevato il numero di pazienti fragili come le rsa per quali l influenza rappresenta una grave minaccia per la salute fronte dei dati di efficacia italia lo staff ospedaliero raggiunge bassa adesione tra il e il mentre scarse sono le evidenze nel contesto delle rsa obiettivo del presente studio mostrare alcuni risultati preliminari sull aderenza alla vaccinazione nelle rsa e confrontare la popolazione di vaccinati e non vaccinati rispetto ad alcuni potenzialmente importanti determinanti gli operatori sanitari os rappresentano la categoria professionale maggiormente esposta rischio di contrarre malattie infettive vaccino prevenibili la vaccinazione dell os strumento di protezione individuale garantisce la continuit dei servizi assistenziali e consente di prevenire la trasmissione degli agenti patogeni le coperture vaccinali negli os restano basse e di conseguenza esitano casi di trasmissione di malattie vaccino prevenibili da os paziente ancora oggi soprattutto nei soggetti adulti le coperture vaccinali sono sub ottimali rispetto atteso particolar modo nelle categorie rischio il pnpv ha individuato nella vaccinazione dell adulto un asset centrale nelle strategie vaccinali nazionali e stabilito che programmi di vaccinazione devono essere oggetto di attenta programmazione organizzazione e gestione da parte delle strutture sanitarie devono essere altres monitorati attraverso l istituzione di un anagrafe vaccinale che alimenti il relativo sistema informativo e di sorveglianza l asp di reggio calabria ha avviato una collaborazione pubblico privata che permette attraverso una

principale codici di sepsi sepsi severa shock settico e setticemia le infezioni correlate assistenza ica sono il pi frequente evento avverso ambito ospedaliero con un trend epidemiologico progressione ed un impatto clinico ed economico rilevante l obiettivo di questo studio stato quello di condurre un indagine di prevalenza puntuale interno dell azienda ospedaliera universitaria policlinico umberto di roma con lo scopo di stimare la prevalenza delle ica e dell uso di antimicrobici e identificare le maggiori aree critiche su cui programmare interventi per il miglioramento della qualit dell assistenza seguito dei richiami di enti governativi relativi alla segnalazione di oltre casi nel mondo di infezione invasive da chimaera pazienti sottoposti ad interventi cardiochirurgici numerosi avvisi di sicurezza sono stati emanati dai principali produttori di hcu dispositivo incriminato nella trasmissione dell infezione la contaminazione fase di produzione di questi dispositivi stata dimostrata per livanova stockert con associati il maggior numero di casi il ministero della salute attraverso la circolare ha emanato le raccomandazioni per il controllo delle infezioni da chimaera richiedendo la sorveglianza microbiologica di tutte le hcus la contaminazione della rete idrica delle strutture sanitarie da legionella spp rimane ancora oggi una questione molto importante nonostante sia dibattuta la diretta correlazione con l incidenza di legionellosi nosocomiali di seguito riportiamo l esperienza acquisita nel nostro ospedale posti letto dopo l introduzione del nuovo protocollo di campionamento e controllo della rete idrica dal e risultati ottenuti con l applicazione di diversi metodi di decontaminazione con un focus sulle aree considerate ad alto rischio come noto un appropriata antibiotico profilassi peri operatoria ha un ruolo importante nella prevenzione delle infezioni del sito chirurgico isc richiede una scelta accurata del tipo antibiotico il rispetto dei tempo di somministrazione e della durata della profilassi antibiotica risulta di conseguenza cruciale il ruolo svolto dagli operatori sanitari coinvolti nell antibiotico profilassi peri operatoria nel prevenire le isc pertanto l obiettivo di questo studio quello di valutare le conoscenze le attitudini e comportamenti dei medici formazione specialistica tema di profilassi antibiotica peri operatoria la resistenza agli antibiotici rappresenta oggi il problema maggior impatto epidemiologico ed economico nel nostro paese per il quale sono urgenti azioni di prevenzione e controllo l italia infatti

siano inseriti lista operatoria tempo utile e caso contrario verificano con clinici che le motivazioni del ritardo non siano imputabili questioni organizzative altrimenti risolvibili si stabilisce che questi interventi hanno caratteristiche di urgenza e casi eccezionali la priorit sull elezione la dmo fornisce alla direzione strategica report mensili cui vengono indicate le motivazioni che hanno portato agli eventuali sforamenti delle tempistiche con direttori delle uoc di ortopedia vengono poi discussi casi per affrontare eventuali criticit organizzative emerse la programmazione sanitarium e l evoluzione epidemiologica atto hanno portato alla necessit da parte delle strutture ospedaliere di sviluppare una riorganizzazione dei percorsi diagnostici terapeutici e assistenziali la nuova tipologia di ospedale deve rispondere ai concetti di tempestivit e appropriatezza con un metodo multiprofessionale e multidisciplinare che consenta allo stesso tempo di ottimizzare l utilizzo delle risorse disposizione lo scopo dello studio di fotografare attraverso una survey di tipo trasversale lo stato dell arte dell implementazione dei modelli organizzativi per intensit di cura utilizzati negli ospedali pubblici della toscana negli ultimi anni si assistito ad un ricorso sempre maggiore modelli di ospedali basati sul partenariato pubblico privato ppp cui la pubblica amministrazione

contrarre e diffondere infezioni colleghi e pazienti pi frequentemente rispetto alla popolazione generale italia le coperture vaccinali degli os non raggiungono l obiettivo minimo desiderabile per nessuna delle vaccinazioni previste per la categoria professionale scopo principale dello studio la valutazione dei tassi di copertura vaccinale negli os formazione dell universit degli studi magna graecia di catanzaro prima e dopo l attivazione di un ambulatorio vaccinale site ulteriori obiettivi saranno indagare tra soggetti che hanno accettato di vaccinarsi motivi della mancata vaccinazione prima dell attivazione dell ambulatorio site e tra soggetti che rifiutano la vaccinazione motivi del rifiuto il tasso di adesione alla vaccinazione stato circa il e la pi frequente motivazione per non aver effettuato precedentemente la vaccinazione sono state le dimenticanze e la mancata proposta numerose ricerche dimostrano che l esposizione ai terremoti pu portare qualit della vita compromessa e sintomi psicologici duraturi spesso diagnosticati come disturbo post traumatico da stress ptsd recenti ricerche su adolescenti hanno suggerito che l esperienza di un terremoto pu aumentare la sensibilit impatto di quelli successivi nostra conoscenza non ci sono studi che indaghino su sequele di esposizione ripetuta tra gli adulti l entroterra marchigiano stato ripetutamente colpito da terremoti di varia intensit particolarmente negli ultimi anni lo scopo del presente studio era di indagare la prevalenza di disturbi mentali sintomi psicologici e qualit della vita percepita una popolazione adulta colpita dal sisma del che ha perso casa e beni causa del terremoto un argomento dibattuto tema di obbligo vaccinale la tutela del diritto dei bambino immunodepressi frequentare nidus e scuola senza particolari rischi un importante obiettivo del programma di prevenzione vaccinale proprio quello di proteggere le persone pi rischio di contrarre infezioni causa delle loro condizioni di salute nell aprile il padre di un bambino immunodepresso iscritto primo anno di una scuola elementare afferente distretto dell asl si rivolto alla direzione del distretto per capire se lo stato immunitario della classe fosse sufficiente garantire una adeguata protezione per la frequenza scolastica del bambino la vaccinazione antinfluenzale degli operatori sanitari ben riconosciuta come misura di sanit pubblica grado di proteggere gli operatori sanitari dall influenza stagionale e pazienti fragili dal rischio delle complicanze essa correlate tuttavia il tasso di copertura vaccinale degli operatori sanitari sia italia che europa risulta essere ampiamente di sotto del target raccomandato minimo del e ottimale del lo scopo del presente studio quello di descrivere le attivit ed risultati ottenuti dalle campagne vaccinali rivolte agli operatori sanitari organizzate seno gruppo di lavoro formazione condivisa dell accademia romana di sanit pubblica durante la stagione quattro policlinici ao universitari di roma lo studio mira valutare la prevalenza e genotipi pi frequentemente responsabili dell infezione da papilloma virus hpv una popolazione di giovani donne vaccinate e non vaccinate co da ottenere informazioni sull impatto della vaccinazione sulla circolazione dei genotipi hpv ulteriori obiettivi sono quello di valutare la copertura vaccinale anti hpv e di esplorare conoscenze attitudini e comportamenti relativi infezione da hpv la ercp rappresenta la procedura endoscopica gravata dal maggior numero di complicanze stato condotto uno studio retrospettivo volto stabilire la frequenza della procedura nella rete ospedaliera della regione veneto e dunque valutare l insorgenza di possibili complicanze oltre associazione con le caratteristiche

primaria delle malattie infettive gli operatori sanitari rivestono un importante ruolo nella diffusione delle informazioni basate sulle evidenze sull efficacia e sulla sicurezza dei vaccini tra questi farmacisti possono svolgere un ruolo chiave nella divulgazione delle corrette informazioni merito alla vaccinoprofilassi pertanto l obiettivo di questo studio valutare conoscenze attitudini e comportamenti dei farmacisti tema di vaccinazioni le crescenti esigenze e aspettative dei pazienti richiedono una valutazione complessiva delle prestazioni ospedaliere diverse agenzie hanno descritto una serie di indicatori di performance e non esiste una classificazione unanime il progetto impacthta vuole affrontare questo aspetto sviluppando un insieme di strumenti di indicatori chiave per misurare le prestazioni dell organizzazione ospedaliera l obiettivo di questa revisione quello di identificare le dimensioni della qualit cui sono raggruppati gli indicatori di prestazione ospedaliera e di valutare se vi sia stata un evoluzione nel tempo delle suddette dimensioni gli anziani pronto soccorso rappresentano una sfida rilevante per sistemi sanitari quanto pazienti complessi con necessit anche sociali che spesso non trovano una adeguata risposta assistenziale nel loro setting domestico e territoriale questo lavoro ha lo scopo di indagare il livello di fragilit nei pazienti anziani che accedono pronto soccorso descrivendone le caratteristiche principali e correlandolo agli outcome gli antibiotici rappresentano la terapia medica pi prescritta pediatrica l uso eccessivo e inappropriato degli antibiotici la causa principale dell emergenza dell antibiotico resistenza obiettivi primari dello studio sono stati la valutazione delle conoscenze tema di antibiotici e antibiotico resistenza e dei comportamenti relativi utilizzo di antibiotici prescritti dal medico automedicazione da parte della popolazione adulta il modello organizzativo ligure del dipartimento interaziendale regionale diar individuato dalle leggi di riforma e avanzato stato di attuazione sussistono tuttavia delle opportunit di miglioramento del modello che sono rappresentate dai processi

rappresentare una fonte rilevante di particolato fine con importanti conseguenze sulla qualit dell aria ambientale scopo di questo studio stato confrontare la capacit di trattenere del particolato utilizzando un filtro di aria di nuova concezione contenente magneti di neodimio mag rispetto un filtro convenzionale nomag la tematica della vaccinazione antitetanica e del possibile rischio di iperimmunizzazione tornata di forte attualit dopo che il piano nazionale prevenzione vaccinale ha confermato la raccomandazione di un richiamo ogni anni dopo quello previsto nell adolescenza raccomandazione ribadita dalla circolare ministeriale cm del luglio la successiva cm novembre raccomanda inoltre la vaccinazione anti pertussica ad ogni gravidanza non essendo disponibile il vaccino monovalente contro la pertosse questa vaccinazione viene effettuata con il vaccino contenuto antigenico ridotto per il tetano dtpa infine nel setting emergenziale dove spesso non si hanno dati completi sulle pregresse vaccinazioni risulta difficile per gli operatori scegliere tra profilassi vaccinale somministrazione di immunoglobuline nessun intervento rimane il dubbio sul possibile rischio di incorrere iperimmunizzazione nei soggetti vaccinati con dosi ripetute breve distanza scopo di questo lavoro verificare le prove sostegno e contro un possibile aumento di rischio il global trigger tool uno strumento per la valutazione e gestione del rischio clinico ideato per rilevare gli eventi potenzialmente avversi nel causare danno paziente scopo dello studio valutare l efficacia di utilizzo della metodologia global trigger tool nel ridurre il rischio clinico pediatria la vaccinazione rappresenta un atto medico estremamente utile ed efficace che ha consentito la prevenzione e alcuni casi l eradicazione di gravi malattie infettive scopo di questo lavoro illustrare alcuni aspetti circa l attuale gestione delle offerte e le coperture vaccinali delle regioni italiane ed evidenziare le differenze talora presenti tra le varie regioni nonostante la vaccinazione rappresenti la misura pi efficace di prevenzione dell influenza livelli di copertura negli operatori sanitari sono lontani dall obiettivo minimo per aumentare l adesione vaccino necessario tra l altro agire sulle determinanti del comportamento vaccinale scopo dell indagine di raccogliere informazioni sulle motivazioni che inducono medici di medicina generale mmg e pediatri di libera scelta pls ad effettuare meno la vaccinazione il burnout un processo stressante che ha avuto negli ultimi anni una crescente prevalenza con il conseguente aumento dei costi connesso un urgente bisogno di interventi di prevenzione il burnout principalmente legato alle cosiddette professioni aiuto ha raggiunto ultimamente anche nei docenti universitari livelli tipici degli operatori sanitari che rappresentano letteratura soggetti rischio pi elevato secondo la recentissima pubblicazione del manuale dell oms risulta che il burnout pu essere oggetto di diagnosi medica e appare nella sezione sui problemi relativi occupazione il riconoscimento del burnout come malattia professionale di fondamentale importanza poich questa sindrome oltre ad avere un azione diretta sull individuo determina un impatto negativo sul gruppo di lavoro conoscerne le cause determinanti consente di porre essere mirate misure preventive lo studio carattere osservazionale ha avuto lo scopo di determinare la prevalenza delle tre dimensioni del burnout tra docenti dell universit degli studi dell aquila e di analizzarne l associazione con le caratteristiche socio demografiche e con quelle relative lavoro il lavoro ha evidenziato che rischi psicosociali rappresentano pi importanti predittori del burnout tra questi la non soddisfazione del rapporto con gli studenti e il rapporto ostile con colleghi aumentano il rischio di esaurimento emotivo rispettivamente lo stroke una patologia che riconosce diverse etiologie e fattori di rischio genetici ormonali attribuibili emicrania cardiologici iatrogeni noto che il del rischio globale di stroke attribuibile fattori di rischio modificabili come ad esempio la dieta obiettivo del nostro studio presentare una revisione delle meta analisi che hanno indagato una possibile associazione tra alimenti bevande come possibili fattori di rischio protettivi nei confronti di eventi di stroke ischemici emorragici icd violenza sul luogo di lavoro un importante problema di sicurezza e di salute con effetti sull individuo e sull organizzazione l episodio di violenza pu determinare conseguenze gravi causare perdita di motivazione ridurre l autostima con ripercussioni sulle performance aziendali la ricerca si propone di indagare il problema nell emergenza urgenza sarda fine di programmare interventi di prevenzione e protezione migliorando la sicurezza negli ambienti di lavoro la resistenza agli antibiotici rappresenta una seria minaccia per la sanit pubblica un utilizzo appropriato e responsabile degli antibiotici potrebbe contribuire ad arrestare il fenomeno per contrastare tale problema stata promossa la campagna siciliana di informazione e comunicazione sulla consapevolezza e uso prudente degli antibiotici obiettivo antibiotico che la regione siciliana nell ambito del piano nazionale di contrasto dell antimicrobico resistenza pncar ha posto come obiettivo prioritario di politica sanitarium obiettivo principale del presente lavoro quello di descrivere la realizzazione della campagna e primo risultati dall avvio l invecchiamento della popolazione porter ad un forte aumento della cronicit nei prossimi anni queste patologie non sono sempre effetto diretto dell invecchiamento spesso conseguenza di stili di vita rischio bisogner quindi agire prevenzione anche individuare modelli di presa carico efficaci e sostenibili con un sempre pi marcato spostamento dell assistenza verso setting territoriali l obiettivo dello studio stato quello di conoscere l opinione dei coordinatori infermieristici marchigiani riguardo l adeguatezza della formazione degli infermieri neoassunti abilitati da non pi di anni alle necessit assistenziali attuali e quelle che presumibilmente si manifesteranno tra anni per individuare eventuali carenze e proporre tempestivamente modifiche nei programmi formativi nonostante vantaggi derivanti dall immunizzazione materna la vaccinazione gravidanza non ancora una pratica routinaria le cause maggiormente associate alla bassa copertura vaccinale sono la mancata raccomandazione da parte del personale sanitario e la convinzione della gestante che la vaccinazione durante la gravidanza abbia effetti rischiosi sul feto l ostetrica gioca un ruolo critico nell informare e nel rassicurare le donne merito uso dei vaccini gravidanza dimostrato infatti che una raccomandazione del medico e di altre figure sanitarie incide favorevolmente sull accettazione della vaccinazione materna fine di determinare principali ostacoli alla protezione delle donne gravide e dei nascituri abbiamo voluto documentare le conoscenze e le attitudini alle pratiche vaccinali durante la gravidanza delle studentesse del corso di laurea ostetricia prima e dopo un intervento formativo sul tema vaccinazione italia la malattia del legionario mdl causa ricoveri ospedalieri anno con letalit del l evidenza

possibili rischi sia di tipo fisico chimico e microbiologico che possono verificarsi questi particolari ambienti non devono essere sottovalutati infatti microrganismi possono formare un biofilm difficilmente eliminabile e come alcuni studi condotti dal dipartimento di microbiologia del texas hanno dimostrato l acqua delle vasche abilitate alla funzione di idromassaggio pu diventare anche grazie alle temperature favorenti il terreno di coltura ideale per differenti tipi di batteri causa di molte malattie tra le quali infezioni del tratto urinario della pelle e di polmoniti pertanto stato pianificato un intervento di prevenzione e controllo su queste particolari tipologie di vasche il potenziale rischio di infezione occupazionale negli impianti di depurazione confermato dagli studi che hanno rilevato tassi anticorpali maggiori nei confronti di patogeni enterici nei lavoratori rispetto alla popolazione generale ed una maggiore incidenza di malattie gastrointestinali e respiratorie nei neoassunti infatti ben nota la presenza nelle matrici trattate durante il processo di depurazione di microrganismi patogeni uova di elminti protozoi batteri miceti e virus con rilevanti caratteristiche infettive allergogene e tossigene tuttavia difficile valutare il rischio occupazionale sia perch talus agenti sono molto diffusi nella popolazione e possono trasmettersi per vie differenti dall inalazione di aerosol il contatto con il liquame sia perch l infezione e la malattia dipendono dal grado di esposizione dalla dose minimum infettante dalla virulenza e dalla suscettibilit individuale un possibile approccio che potrebbe risolvere parte questi limiti quello come gi suggerito da recenti studi dell utilizzo della quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra

sottolineano il ruolo che l esercizio fisico ricopre non solo per mantenere lo stato di buona salute fisica e mentale anche nella prevenzione e nella cura delle malattie croniche non trasmissibili ne

individuava la rilevanza del ruolo della prevenzione e della responsabilizzazione del cittadino nel diventare protagonista del proprio stato di salute seguito grazie documenti programmatici guadagnare salute rendere facili le scelte salutari e ai piani nazionali della prevenzione dal negli ultimi anni sono state rafforzate nel nostro paese le azioni tese alla promozione della salute il programma guadagnare salute nasce dall esigenza di rendere pi facili le scelte salutari e di promuovere campagne informative che mirino modificare comportamenti inadeguati che favoriscono l insorgere di malattie degenerative di grande rilevanza epidemiologica fattori di rischio sono prevedibili ed esistono politiche ed interventi efficaci che possono agire globalmente su di essi e sulle condizioni

parte pi impulsiva e viscerale della persona nudging migliorare la salute richiede la modificazione degli stili di vita delle persone attraverso interventi rivolti non solo singolo individuo anche cambiamento di condizioni sociali e degli ambienti dove si vive e si lavora pertanto necessaria un azione intersettoriale e trasversale che veda coinvolti governi la scuola l industria le associazioni affinch concorrano per la creazione di un ambiente favorevole per produrre salute quest ultima deve essere vista come una risorsa per vivere appieno la vita quotidiana piuttosto che obiettivo del vivere fine se stesso necessario che gli interventi di promozione della salute vengano monitorati e il loro impatto sia valutato mediante sistemi di sorveglianza e che le best practice vengano diffuse tutte le decisioni politiche manageriali e professionali che riguardano la salute delle persone purtroppo l allocazione delle risorse tende prediligere gli strumenti di cura piuttosto che quelli di cultura e prevenzione questa tendenza si combatte rendendo consapevoli decisori politici della necessit della promozione della salute tutte le politiche e del conseguente riorientamento del ssn servono politici e professionisti coraggiosi con una visione di lungo respiro questo proposito chan direttore generale dell oms afferma gli sforzi per prevenire le malattie croniche vanno contro gli

formazione universitaria e la sanit pubblica tenutasi palermo nel facendo riferimento alla storia millenaria dell universit identificavano nel novecento il periodo nel quale l universit diventata una istituzione primo luogo scientifica precisando che lo diventata modo co completo che universit e scienza professore e scienziato sono ormai terminus pressoch sinonimi molti paesi soprattutto quelli tecnologicamente pi progrediti nella stessa occasione sottolineavano che sin dai suoi esordi la scienza si presentata come una sfida ortodossia tradizionale essenzialmente la scienza nel senso moderno l applicazione della ragione umana alla soluzione di problemi facendo ricorso ad una metodologia di base consistente nella successione dei seguenti momenti formulazione di un problema ipotesi di soluzione controllo e soluzione corredata di dimostrazione queste considerazioni sulla scienza e sulla ricerca universitaria pur formulate quasi trenta anni fa parlano presente e futuro della ricerca sanit pubblica individuandone il carattere di continuum sfida metodologica e fortemente orientato agli aspetti applicativi per la soluzione dei problemi di salute delle comunit tali peculiarit rendono la ricerca sanit pubblica e particolare quella orientata alla definizione delle politiche per la salute ancor pi complessa come affermato da hegger la definizione delle politiche per la salute un processo complesso e l uso delle conoscenze scientifiche questo campo noto anche come knowledge utilization non self evident e la definizione delle politiche sanitarie il processo di individuazione del problema e di formulazione implementazione e valutazione dell insieme delle azioni necessarie per la soluzione del problema questo contesto l interazione tra ricercatori operatori di sanit pubblica e decisori politici cruciale per la realizzazione di efficaci politiche per la tutela e la promozione della salute importante allora analizzare quali possano essere le ulteriori sfide scientifiche che la disciplina deve affrontare per lo sviluppo di politiche sanitarie grado di raggiungere due principali obiettivi che la sanit pubblica si propone contrastare le patologie e promuovere la salute delle comunit tal senso possibile individuare alcune macro direttrici della ricerca applicata alla sanit pubblica quali la realizzazione di un adeguata governance della produzione delle evidenze il loro trasferimento ed implementazione alle pratiche di sanit pubblica e la valutazione dell impatto delle politiche sanitarie la definizione stessa di sanit pubblica partire da quella formulata da winslow nel ha suscitato acceso dibattito sui precisi confini delle pratiche di sanit pubblica relazione sia alla pratica medica che ad altri settori le cui attivit incidono sulla salute della popolazione quali lo sviluppo urbano l istruzione l industria trasporti e l ambiente per citarne solo alcuni nel tempo per pi rilevanti risultati ottenuti grazie agli interventi di sanit pubblica quali la sicurezza degli alimenti la potabilizzazione dell acqua destinata consumo umano il controllo delle malattie trasmissibili e prevenibili mediante vaccino non si sono paradossalmente accompagnati ad un incremento della percezione del loro valore nella popolazione e nei decisori politici questa tendenza ha dato l avvio ad un inesorabile processo di definanziamento degli interventi di sanit pubblica e indebolimento delle strutture di governance sebbene il cambiamento delle dinamiche di mercato e la globalizzazione abbiano aumentato la necessit di risorse da destinare ai servizi di sanit pubblica e ai percorsi per garantire la qualit delle prestazioni sanitarie la produzione delle evidenze noto che gli interventi di sanit pubblica sono progettati per migliorare la salute della popolazione e di specifici sottogruppi e dei singoli e spaziano dalle vaccinazioni per la prevenzione delle comuni malattie infettive ai programmi per prevenire l obesit tra bambino scolare campagne dirette alla disassuefazione dal fumo gli interventi di sanit pubblica devono tuttavia essere rigorosamente valutati per garantire che fondi ad essa assegnati vengano spesi nel modo pi efficace possibile e che gli interventi potenzialmente non efficaci dannosi non vengano invece attuati l applicazione dell approccio evidence based gi ampiamente e con successo adottato nella pratica clinica presenta alcune difficolt relativamente alle problematiche preventive e pi globalmente agli interventi di sanit pubblica appare necessario innanzitutto superare antichi e nuovi ostacoli per molti interventi preventivi e di sanit pubblica sono tutt oggi utilizzati studi quasi sperimentali trasversali analisi time series che non consentono molti casi di garantire un adeguata qualit delle evidenze e soprattutto la generalizzabilit dei risultati nella maggioranza dei casi gli studi non possono dimostrare il rapporto di causalit con assoluta certezza le prove di efficacia vengono spesso generate nell ambito di progetti di ricerca che devono sopravvivere sistema di revisione tra pari che privilegia la validit interna rispetto quella esterna studi approvati e finanziati molto spesso sono condotti contesti di maggiore disponibilit di risorse e da personale altamente qualificato gli interventi che ne derivano pertanto possono essere difficili da attuare nel mondo reale emerge pertanto prepotente la necessit per informare le pratiche e le politiche di sanit pubblica di condurre la ricerca condizioni molto simili quelle reali cui diverse popolazioni sono esposte non esposte una condizione potenzialmente causale ad esempio una nuova politica di educazione alimentare una scuola nuove politiche per la disassuefazione dal fumo di tabacco che ricalchi il disegno di uno studio cui partecipanti sono casualmente assegnati ai gruppi sebbene gli studi conosciuti come pragmatic trial siano pi soggetti bias di selezione questi riflettono modo pi fedele ci che sta accadendo nel contesto reale rispetto ad uno studio metodologicamente pi rigoroso e nel contempo offrono la possibilit di dimostrare se un intervento sanitario di documentata efficacy dotato di effectiveness una popolazione eterogenea condizioni reali naturalmente questo approccio non scevro di ostacoli come evidenziato da craig che suggeriscono alcune modalit per rafforzare l inferenza causale emerge pertanto la complessit di determinare quando l evidenza scientifica sufficiente per prendere decisioni sulle azioni e gli interventi da intraprendere sanit pubblica sebbene alcune occasioni l attesa delle prove di efficacia comporterebbe non accettabili ritardi nell applicazione di cruciali interventi di sanit pubblica il radon rappresenta un fattore di rischio certo e non trascurabile per le

sufficiente per tutti uno degli obiettivi dell agenda per lo sviluppo sostenibile che prevede di ridurre minimo il rilascio di sostanze chimiche e materiali pericolosi di dimezzare la percentuale di acque reflue non trattate e di aumentare il riutilizzo sicurezza livello globale la scarsit idrica rappresenta infatti una delle pi importanti emergenze globali secondo il world economic forum global

delle aree umide e quello potabile sia come consumo diretto che attraverso la ricarica delle falde applicato aree che non hanno disponibilit sufficiente di fonti alternative anche se il riuso ormai ritenuto indispensabile la sua applicazione ancora insufficiente causa di barriere di carattere normativo tecnologico economico e sociale fra queste rischi per l uomo e per l ambiente sono pi rilevanti poich possono ostacolare benefici del riuso la disponibilit di acqua deve essere vista un ottica non solo meramente quantitativa anche qualitativa per gli impatti che essa pu avere sulla salute degli ecosistemi e dell uomo la qualit dell acqua di riuso rappresenta anche una barriera accettazione sociale di tale pratica indagini condotte vari paesi hanno infatti mostrato una grande diffidenza nei confronti del riutilizzo soprattutto scopo potabile anche irriguo ed urbano per superarla necessario un importante sforzo comunicativo soprattutto la garanzia che l acqua riciclata abbia una qualit non inferiore quella derivante dalle fonti naturali pericoli per la salute e l ambiente reflui di origine civile contengono un ampia variet di contaminanti microbici e chimici che raccolti dal sistema fognario si concentrano livello degli impianti di depurazione la pericolosit di talus inquinanti dipende non solo dai loro effetti patogeni anche dalla loro resistenza ai trattamenti e persistenza ambientale fino ad oggi pericoli pi noti associati riutilizzo di reflui civili sono stati quelli di tipo infettivo gastroenteriti epatiti infezioni respiratorie ed hanno riguardato il consumo dei prodotti irrigati e l esposizione lavorativa per contatto aerosol microrganismi patogeni di provenienza enterica virus batteri protozoi e uova di elminti sono presenti nei liquami urbani concentrazioni anche molto elevate dell ordine di per l e sono ridotti dai trattamenti convenzionali di non pi di log tuttavia evidenze epidemiologiche e studi di risk assessment qmra dimostrano la necessit di usare acque di buona qualit microbiologica per l irrigazione di prodotti da consumare crudi ed tal fine l efficienza richiesta dai trattamenti dovrebbe raggiungere log inoltre fino ad os nella stima dei valori accettabili non si tenuto conto della dimostrata internalizzazione di batteri e virus per assorbimento radicale che renderebbe inefficace il lavaggio dei prodotti se invece reflui depurati vengono utilizzati scopo industriale il rischio maggiore per l uomo rappresentato dall esposizione dei lavoratori bioaerosol ad e contaminato da legionelle prodotto nei processi di raffreddamento e che pu estendersi alle popolazioni limitrofe agli impianti particolari condizioni sebbene tale pericolo non sia da escludere qualunque sia il tipo di acque usate per il raffreddamento quelle di riuso per il loro maggiore contenuto flora microbica e nutrienti sono particolarmente rischio per quanto riguarda pericoli di natura chimica da riutilizzo dei reflui l interesse continuo aumento anche se molti casi le conoscenze necessarie per valutarne il rischio sono ancora insufficienti potenziali effetti nocivi sulla salute riguardano soprattutto patologie cronico degenerative particolare tumori e malattie neurologiche anche effetti sulla fertilit sul feto e sul sistema endocrino la via di esposizione principale sarebbe rappresentata dall ingestione dei prodotti irrigati di acqua contaminata infatti nei liquami si ritrova un enorme variet di sostanze potenzialmente dannose quelle normalmente derivanti dai processi depurativi particolare nutrienti nitrati fosfati ecc responsabili di problemi ambientali come l eutrofizzazione si affiancano le sostanze tossiche fra cui metalli pesanti ed cosiddetti compounds emerging concern cecs che comprendono residui di farmaci ed antibiotici pesticidi prodotti di uso casalingo e per la cura personale ormoni naturali e sintetici e composti di origine industriale ritardanti di fiamma plastificanti additivi alimentari ecc tali sostanze sono presenti concentrazioni dell ordine dei micro nanogrammi per litro di liquame anche adsorbite micro e nanoparticelle ad e microplastiche miscele complesse e diverse seconda dei contesti sebbene la lista di talus sostanze sia molto lunga svariati studi riportano che le concentrazioni rilevate sono di sotto di quelle pericolose tuttavia tutti gli studi e le linee guida sottolineano la necessit di tenere questo problema debito conto per la valutazione dei rischi basandosi sul principio di precauzione adottando trattamenti idonei abbattimento e mettendo misure preventive livello ambientale le acque di riuso potrebbero contaminare le acque profonde e superficiali cambiare le caratteristiche agronomiche dei suoli alterandone il ph la salinit la concentrazione di nutrienti di metalli pesanti e di prodotti fitotossici e modificarne le propriet idrauliche con riduzione della porosit aumento di ristagni ruscellamento ed erosione il riutilizzo di consistenti volumi di acqua potrebbero sottrarla alla reimmissione nell ambiente riducendone la disponibilit per altri usi le sostanze tossiche anche piccole quantit potrebbero andare incontro bioaccumulo e biomagnificazione negli organismi raggiungendo concentrazioni pericolose apice della catena alimentare anche contesti diversi da quello agricolo come ad esempio le acque marino costiere convenzionali trattamenti dei liquami urbani spesso non sono efficaci per eliminare le sostanze chimiche pericolose infatti il disegno originario di talus impianti progettati per rimuovere soprattutto nutrienti ed evitare l eutrofizzazione prevedeva un trattamento primario ed uno secondario del refluo accompagnati da un trattamento dei fanghi l emergenza di nuovi problemi di contaminazione l evoluzione normativa sugli scarichi e la spinta riutilizzo rendono necessari trattamenti molto pi spinti di quelli primari e secondari e la verifica della loro efficacia ai fini del destino dell effluente esistono vari trattamenti avanzati per la rimozione dei contaminanti alcuni consolidati carbone attivo ozonizzazione e filtrazione su membrana altri pi recenti processi ossidativi avanzati ed altri ancora livello di sperimentazione piccola scala tuttavia anche gli stessi trattamenti possono avere effetti collaterali negativi causa del consumo energetico dei materiali di scarto dei costi ed definitiva dell impatto ambientale e sanitario quindi la scelta e l applicazione delle modalit di riuso debbono essere affrontate un ottica di analisi rischi benefici per scegliere e mettere punto le soluzioni pi adatte alle varie situazioni il riutilizzo dei reflui deve essere gestito con particolare attenzione ai rischi per l uomo e per l ambiente secondo principi della salute globale e con l approccio dell analisi del rischio tale scopo sono necessarie competenze specifiche una formazione igienistica appare quindi fondamentale per tutte le figure professionali che intervengano questo contesto le scosse principali si sono verificate il agosto e il ottobre con magnitudine di il ottobre stata registrata la scossa pi forte di magnitudo momento con epicentro tra comuni di norcia e preci provincia di perugia questo insieme di eventi ha provocato tutto circa sfollati feriti e morti dei quali morirono per via indiretta causa infarto per lo spavento primo soccorsi sono arrivati sui luoghi del sisma gi poche ore dalla scossa del agosto seppur con un certo ritardo nel raggiungere le frazioni pi isolate causa dei numerosi ponti crollati e delle strade ostruite dalle macerie il giorno seguente il numero totale di soccorritori messi campo ammontava unit seguito del terremoto del agosto con il decreto legge ottobre e con successiva legge di conversione dicembre interventi urgenti favore delle popolazioni colpite dal sisma del agosto viene istituito un elenco per un totale di comuni nella gestione della ricostruzione il governo italiano ha scelto sin dall inizio di allontanarsi dal cosiddetto modello bertolaso impiegato nel terremoto dell aquila caratterizzato da una gestione centralizzata e dal frequente ricorso poteri straordinari come disposto dalla legge che ridefinisce la prima fase dell emergenza specificando che poteri straordinari per fronteggiare le calamit vanno utilizzati per interventi temporali limitati e predefiniti lasciando poi proseguire le attivit alle amministrazioni competenti via ordinaria decentrando le decisioni nei territori un altra decisione presa per richiesta dei sindaci del cratere stata quella di ricostruire centri abitati dove erano evitando la costruzione di new town per l alloggiamento degli sfollati tuttavia successivamente sindaci del cratere hanno denunciato la presenza di un eccessiva burocrazia che ha rallentato la ricostruzione dieci mesi dalla prima scossa erano state consegnate solo casette e soluzioni abitative emergenza sulle richieste mentre il delle macerie attendeva ancora di essere rimosso gli eventi sismici hanno avuto comune alcuni aspetti sociosanitari ed organizzativi l inagibilit di una serie di strutture ospedaliere e sanitarie nell area del cratere mentre altre sedi legate alla pubblica assistenza sono state pesantemente compromesse soccorsi sono intervenuti molto precocemente rispetto ad altre situazioni simili precedenti grazie miglior funzionamento della macchina organizzativa e della protezione civile nell arco delle ore post sisma sono state approntate le misure di emergenza con presa carico delle necessit impellenti per garantire modo efficace l organizzazione sanitarium ovvero evacuazioni ore delle strutture ospedaliere e territoriali co come disposte dagli organi tecnici della protezione civile immediata riorganizzazione delle attivit clinico sanitarie e di

psicofisico della popolazione colpita e sulla valutazione della qualit della vita percepita tale approccio stato poi utilizzato anche occasione del terremoto del molise del e del terremoto dell aquila del occasione degli eventi del emerso che parte del campione esaminato mostra una forte intensit di sintomi psicologici il circa del campione esaminato ha probabile ptsd e il circa manifesta disturbi psichici soggetti con probabile ptsd riferiscono anche una minore qualit della vita valutando la situazione relativa alla sistemazione abitativa le problematiche sembrano essere maggiori coloro che vivono autonoma sistemazione soprattutto riferimento ai sintomi psicologici sintesi gli eventi sismici dell italia centrale hanno evidenziato grande capacit di reazione della macchina sanitarium sull onda emotiva efficienza del sistema di ricezione della rete ospedaliera discreto funzionamento dei piani di massimo afflusso peimaf sebbene si sia evidenziata la neces sit di una manutenzione organizzativa e monitoraggio della performance debolezza della funzione di coordinamento legata alle diverse competenze regionali parzialmente compensata dalle diverse organizzazioni aziendali debolezza della funzione amministrativa legata soprattutto ad una sovrapposizione normativa nazionale e regionale e diversa applicazione della normativa sul ticket e alla rigidit del sistema degli acquisti nuovo codice appalti e disposizioni anticorruzione ci rende necessaria una formazione specifica preliminare per la gestione amministrativa dei disastri mancanza di flessibilit di sistema nella gestione straordinaria delle risorse umane e assunzioni temporanee e spostamento del personale necessit di elaborare linee guida e sperimentazioni organizzative per la preparedness ad esempio nel campo epidemiologico per la costituzione di coorti di studio per la sorveglianza post emergenza per migliorare le modalit di raccordo con la protezione civile e gli enti locali comprese le strutture per la ricostruzione infine per l adeguamento temporaneo delle risorse logistiche delle aziende sanitarie coinvolte definitiva emerge la necessit di studiare gli effetti sulla salute medio e lungo termine delle persone colpite da catastrofi naturali si ritiene importante implementare una rete di professionisti che operino sotto il coordinamento di un osservatorio epidemiologico nazionale e che regolarmente ed maniera coordinata raccolgano ed analizzino set di dati di grandi dimensioni beneficio della sorveglianza epidemiologica dell emergenza tale approccio collaborativo migliorerebbe la qualit e la velocit della risposta fase di emergenza sia da parte delle strutture locali che di quelle nazionali qualit e velocit che dovrebbero essere garantite grazie alla formazione degli attori principalmente coinvolti ed alla possibilit di applicare quanto previsto da linee guida nazionali che tengano debito conto la problematica del post emergenza e dei possibili effetti lungo termine sulla salute umana cosicch l intervento possa essere uniforme su tutto il territorio nazionale per ogni tipologia di catastrofe il piano nazionale della cronicit sottolinea come la crescita ineluttabile di tale area determini un impegno molto consistente di risorse per una continuit di cure di lunghi periodi con la necessit di una forte integrazione e coordinamento dei servizi sanitari e socio sanitari e degli operatori interessati fronte di una situazione nazionale molto diversificata per ambiti territoriali il piano individua delle fasi di sviluppo di un disegno strategico che le diverse regioni italiane potranno attuare sul proprio territorio considerazione dei servizi e delle risorse disponibili secondariamente detta le linee di indirizzo per patologie con specifici bisogni assistenziali e si pone l obiettivo di influenzare la storia ed il decorso di molte patologie croniche terminus di prevenzione presa carico miglioramento clinico organizzativo attraverso un percorso assistenziale definito infatti l invecchiamento della popolazione con l intensificarsi della complessit assistenziale dovuta aumentata gravit ed numero di anni vissuti con disabilit ne aumenter la probabilit di non autosufficienza aggravata da un indebolimento della rete familiare di sostegno dovuta ai nuovi stili di vita con un impegno economico per sistemi sanitari avanzati come il nostro stimabile nel delle risorse sanitarie affidate questa deriva potr essere affrontata attraverso almeno tre direttrici la ricerca di maggiore efficienza definizione di priorit con adozione di esplicite scelte di razionamento e la ricerca di risorse aggiuntive molte di queste azioni sono gi state intraprese da anni tante regioni avviate altre e se quindi l efficientamento inteso senso tradizionale ha esaurito almeno molti contesti le proprie potenzialit l unico modo per conseguire benefici apprezzabili terminus di efficienza anche di qualit e appropriatezza dei servizi diventa la ricerca di innovazioni di prodotto e di processo cio di soluzioni che garantiscano una maggiore integrazione delle risorse degli interventi delle professionalit esempi ne sono l introduzione di modelli assistenziali basati sulla logica della presa carico del paziente cronico quali la riorganizzazione degli ospedali per intensit di cura lo sviluppo di reti interaziendali per patologia la creazione di forme di associazionismo che coinvolgano medici di medicina generale infermieri e specialisti ad e case della salute percorsi diagnostico terapeutico assistenziali pdta l approccio del case management la creazione di percorsi riabilitativi terapeutici individuali l assistenza domiciliare multi disciplinare e pi generale le cure intermedie nella struttura della popolazione italiana diventa preponderante considerare che oltre il di coloro che sono nella fascia tra e anni presenta tre pi malattie croniche pertanto andando stratificare la popolazione dei cronici sempre pi dovremo affrontare la polipatologia ed introdurre la fragilit come un entit multidimensionale che rappresenta la perdita di riserva funzionale diversi organi dunque un soggetti fragili e vulnerabili con una ridotta risposta agli agenti stressogeni e un elevato rischio di sviluppo di disabilit la fragilit diventa un indicatore di non autosufficienza nello svolgimento delle attivit della vita quotidiana e costituisce pertanto un enorme fonte di consumo di risorse sanitarie e assistenziali per la nostra societ la fragilit non corrisponde alla disabilit ne un precursore diretto perch connette le dimensioni biologica e soggettiva di perdita di resistenza e di capacit di adattamento agli eventi negativi e ai fattori di cambiamento fornire un supporto alla fragilit significa allora prevenire e allontanare il momento della non autosufficienza cui il bisogno di assistenza diventa elevato fattori di fragilit possono essere ricondotti tre gruppi funzionali clinici e sociali queste considerazioni rafforzano la necessit di un cambio di paradigma nell affrontare la cronicit che deve tenere considerazione tutti gli interventi di prevenzione e promozione della salute possibili atti rallentamento della degenerazione funzionale e lo sviluppo di una rete di assistenza primaria che coinvolga mmg infermieri e specialisti attorno ai modelli organizzativi come quelli gi descritti serve anche orientarsi verso una visione pi evoluta di responsabilizzazione e consapevolezza anche le forze della comunit civile tutta non solo servizi sociali e le istituzioni ben associazioni di cittadini che sperimentino attraverso forme di community building la partecipazione attiva fra attori di natura diversa enti pubblici privati singoli cittadini ecc volta ad innovare le politiche pubbliche e favorire processi collettivi che sostengano diventandone loro stessi risorse del sistema un percorso di salute e benessere del singolo e della comunit un ottica che vada oltre l interesse individuale seguendo questo filone le case della salute per la loro vicinanza territorio e conseguente prossimit rispetto ai bisogni della popolazione affetta da patologie croniche possono svolgere un importante funzione ricompositiva di risorse coordinamento e personalizzazione dell assistenza il tema dell organizzazione dei servizi sanitari extraospedalieri da anni ordine del giorno anche causa di alcune criticit servate nei servizi ospedalieri ed attribuite alle carenze di servizi territoriali l obiettivo di questa relazione quello di offrire elementi che possano indirizzare verso un modello di gestione delle cure territoriali efficace sia terminus di miglioramento della qualit della vita dei cittadini sia di impiego delle risorse socio sanitarie disponibili la metodologia si basa sull uso di dati di contesto provenienti da fonti ufficiali interno dei quali descrivere e valutare gli elementi provenienti da pi indagini condotte sul campo dai ricercatori del dipartimento di biomedicina e prevenzione dell universit degli studi di roma tor vergata collaborazione con altri enti e personale di ricerca il primo elemento da considerare proveniente da un indagine corso da anni su una popolazione rappresentativa degli anziani del lazio l esistenza di una sottopopolazione di consistenza inferiore del totale degli arruolati che manifesta un elevata frequenza di ricovero e di uso del ps medium pi di volta l anno tale popolazione imputabile oltre il degli accessi ps ed oltre il dei ricoveri registrati un periodo di tre anni di osservazione l analisi multivariata dei determinanti dell uso dei servizi ospedalieri per acuti mette luce l associazione tra maggiore precariet sociale e maggiore uso dei servizi indipendentemente dalla patologie specifiche di cui soggetti soffrono l isolamento sociale il maggiore determinante di un uso frequente dei servizi ospedalieri indirizzando verso un approccio alle cure territoriali che permetta di identificare maniera proattiva soggetti ad alto rischio di eventi negativi quali l ospedalizzazione l istituzionalizzazione e la morte che oltre peggiorare la qualit della vita e la sopravvivenza dei cittadini rappresentano un carico economico ed organizzativo probabilmente limitabile questo senso la valutazione multidimensionale della fragilit costituisce uno strumento originale ed efficace che permetterebbe ai servizi di focalizzarsi sui soggetti maggiore rischio pi fragili con attivit di prevenzione e cura grado di ottimizzare costi e l uso delle risorse socio sanitarie disposizione come avviene nel caso di interventi fondati sull impiego dell infermiere di comunit affiancato da un robusto intervento sociale conclusione la valutazione della fragilit accompagnata da servizi socio sanitari realmente integrati sul territorio rappresenta una possibile chiave per migliorare la qualit della vita dei cittadini e quella dell assistenza ad essi prestata dai servizi questo senso la siti lazio ha presentato dicembre scorso un articolata proposta di sperimentazione attualmente ancora valutazione da parte della regione lazio ai medici di organizzazione non mancano occasioni di sfida e opportunit per progettare il futuro e riposizionare il proprio ruolo nell attuale transizione patto che acquisiscano ulteriori competenze per sostenere un impegno di rilevante complessit allo stato attuale non facile indicare modelli univoci perch le esperienze sono disomogenee e l impianto teorico ancora privo di riferimenti consolidati oltre quanto sinteticamente illustrato riteniamo tuttavia che migliori traguardi per le dmo e l ospedale si possano raggiungere rinnovando l impegno dimostrato dai medici di matrice igienistica altre occasioni di radicale trasformazione del sistema sanitario riforma ospedaliera istituzione del ssn aziendalizzazione cui sono stati capaci di esaltare le competenze distintive di sanit pubblica che differenziano il loro operare da quello dei colleghi clinici rendendolo complementare la sanit pubblica contribuisce alla sostenibilit dei sistemi sanitari tramite strumenti di prevenzione programmazione ed organizzazione dei servizi tale ambito le scelte per la salute devono tener conto del vincolo delle risorse organismi internazionali letteratura scientifica e norme nazionali forniscono indicazioni su conoscenze e abilit necessarie alla costruzione di un profilo manageriale una recente survey su specializzandi italiani sanit pubblica ha rivelato un significativo gap tra la formazione manageriale percepita come necessaria ed il training ricevuto pertanto necessario individuare framework di riferimento e modalit con cui le core competence rilevanti per la formazione manageriale degli specializzandi leadership system thinking capacity building pianificazione finanziaria e management possano essere trasferite dal sistema formativo agli stessi si definisce management l attivit di orientare ad un risultato un set definito di risorse ottica di sostenibilit processi di decision making manageriale ambito sanitario si avvalgono del cosiddetto ciclo manageriale articolato momenti programmazione organizzazione e valutazione la quale consiste nel monitoraggio e nell applicazione di azioni correttive questo ciclo aperto costituendo co una spirale di miglioramento continuo pi recentemente si evidenziato come anche la funzione di leadership si sviluppi secondo fasi di una dinamica interconnessa alla spirale sopradescritta tale decision making si esercita organizzazioni sanitarie caratterizzate da complessit definita da relazioni che ne generano loro volta delle altre le propriet di talus sistemi complessi sono non linearit auto organizzazione sviluppo di nuove forme non riconducibili alla somma delle parti originarie regole semplici che influenzano il sistema ci si aggiunge il recente orientamento di gestire servizi riconoscendo primato alla qualit sui costi rendendo la dimensione economica funzionale raggiungimento di esiti clinici appropriatezza sicurezza soddisfazione dell assistito della comunit e dei professionisti questi ultimi sempre pi inseriti team multiprofessionali e multidisciplinari il management sanitario scientifico necessita di continui approfondimenti e di idonee metodologie e strumenti per il trasferimento di talus contenuti specializzandi e professionisti di sanit pubblica tra questi ricordiamo l adozione dei principi dell evidence based management e dell evidence based healthcare utile inoltre la condivisione di momenti formativi prospettiva multidisciplinare e multiprofessionale per varie scuole ed operatori accademie di sanit pubblica momenti congressuali condivisi materiale rete skill factories la formazione si alimenta dei prodotti della ricerca pertanto la ricerca valutativa sui modelli di policy e management che impattano su salute processi assistenziali e utilizzo delle risorse ed equit di accesso rappresenta un fattore rilevante per la crescita dei professionisti ambito manageriale cos si realizza quella preziosa sinergia che unisce esperienze sul campo e metodo scientifico il corretto impiego del movimento quale strumento di contrasto alla sedentariet e di promozione della salute nei programmi di sanit pubblica costituisce un obiettivo ambizioso e complesso che pu essere raggiunto non solo attraverso la sensibilizzazione e l educazione dei cittadini riguardo ai benefici derivanti dalla pratica di attivit motorie anche attraverso imprescindibili interventi livello sociale economico e politico che ne rendano possibili l implementazione la conduzione e la fruizione la promozione dell attivit fisica deve pertanto essere una priorit condivisa dalle politiche sanitarie e sociali mediante un approccio intersettoriale e multidisciplinare il vari progetti per promuovere l attivit motoria sul territorio si sono caratterizzati per la intersettorialit sostenibilit ed efficacia dell intervento una prima fase stata condotta una campagna di informazione sui benefici dell attivit motoria e sui rischi della vita sedentaria sono stati coinvolti diversi attori presenti sul territorio con l obiettivo di costruire e realizzare politiche di salute comuni l implementazione del progetto ha consentito di mettere atto un lavoro di squadra favorendo l integrazione tra diversi operatori per la migliore diffusione di stili di vita salutari una successiva raccolta ed elaborazione di tuti dati permetter un analisi sui risultati raggiunti sulla promozione dello stato di salute della popolazione attraverso l attivit motoria e art il medico competente collabora anche alla attuazione e valorizzazione di programmi volontari di promozione della salute secondo principi della responsabilit sociale altres investito tempo e risorse per mettere disposizione di questi ultimi un modello formativo e organizzativo per la progettazione e la realizzazione di interventi di promozione della salute e per la costruzione di competenze la diffusione delle pratiche di whp tuttora insoddisfacente tra programmi whp avvallati da parte dell european network workplace health promotion enwhp sono generalmente previsti la promozione di una corretta alimentazione il contrasto fumo di tabacco la promozione dell attivit fisica e della sicurezza stradale anche per tramite di una mobilit sostenibile il contrasto consumo dannoso di alcool e altre dipendenze la promozione della conciliazione vita lavoro ed infine il benessere sul lavoro atto pratico le poche statistiche nazionali disposizione per altro estrapolate da uno strumento assai critico quale l allegato ex lgs lasciano intendere che il mc continui considerare tale ambito operativo del tutto ancillare alla pi convenzionale sorveglianza sanitaria dei lavoratori la diffusione della sorveglianza sanitarium dei lavoratori secondo presupposti del lgs un sostanziale unicum nel contesto operativo europeo ed internazionale costituirebbe del resto un occasione unica nel nostro paese per contattare un gran numero di soggetti che molti casi non si sarebbero recati volontariamente dal medico consentendo intrinsecamente un apertura importante verso una maggiore sensibilizzazione ai problemi degli stili di vita e del benessere particolare per quei contesti lavorativi di piccole dimensioni cui il ruolo del mc pu essere pi critico e decisivo sfortunatamente bench non sia ancora disponibile una decisiva evidenza scientifica particolare relativa nostro paese molte esperienze indicano che la buona efficacia degli interventi di wph sembri crescere proporzionalmente con il numero degli impiegati e con il crescere delle dimensioni organizzazioni e budget delle aziende che li promuovono altre parole ben lungi dall ottenere una pi capillare diffusione della whp anche nei contesti meno strutturati quello che si va concretizzando un contesto estesamente ed impropriamente dicotomizzato da una parte aziende di piccole dimensioni e artigianali con limitato sostanzialmente nullo accesso ad interventi whp dall altro le grandi aziende nelle quali forse indirettamente beneficiando dell identificazione come intervento ai limiti dei c benefit aziendali la sussistenza della whp e l efficacia degli interventi promossi nel suo contesto sembrano spesso pi correlati costo dell appalto per la sorveglianza sanitarium e relativo budget che alla loro effettiva opportunit necessit e quindi ad un effettivo disegno preventivo il che atto pratico estende dubbi relativi ad opportunit e correttezza di tanti interventi promozionali anche ad alcuni ambiti della whp che questo contesto rischia di diventare sul lungo periodo una forma di moltiplicazione di spesa quest ultimo aspetto particolarmente critico se da un lato gli interventi propri della whp non prevedono stringenti vincoli operativi fatta parziale eccezione per il solo contrasto dell alcolismo e quindi non prevedono nemmeno sanzioni caso di inadempienze pochissimi casi essi sono valutati con rigorose metodiche di analisi del rapporto costo benefici con roi ad esempio probabilmente quanto risiedenti questa zona grigia gli interventi di whp non sono spesso menzionati nei report ufficiali relativi alla attivit di controllo espletata dagli organi di vigilanza e sembrano anche carenti nelle strutture industriali artigianali ed anche molte strutture sanitarie territoriali salvo la tematica vaccinale una visione olistica e attuale cui si prospetta una promozione della salute di tipo tipicamente interdisciplinare programmi di whp non solo e non soltanto dovrebbero mirare alla creazione di ambienti che consentano di offrire un adeguato supporto alle persone per il perseguimento della salute condizioni di vita e di lavoro dovrebbero sviluppare maggiormente la opportunit di procedere alla realizzazione di situazioni dalle quali ne derivino maggiore sicurezza e gratificazione assenza di condizioni di stress lavoro correlato accomodamento ragionevole aumento capacit di resilienza

implicazioni pratiche sia per il medico del lavoro medico competente sia per le agenzie autorit sanitarie infatti lo studio epidemiologico degli infortuni ambito sanitario unitamente allo studio dei relativi determinanti pu consentire di orientare interventi mirati materia di prevenzione fine di tutelare la salute e la sicurezza degli operatori sanitari queste evidenze forniranno la base su cui sviluppare un questionario validato per la seconda fase del progetto l implementazione di progetti di ricerca per la valutazione del rischio professionale ambito sanitario unitamente allo studio interventi di prevenzione mirati costituiscono la base per sviluppare programmi di formazione applicabili su larga scala gruppi professionali omogenei monitorabili nel tempo breve e medio termine tali conoscenze potranno risultare funzionali ad agevolare l adempimento degli obblighi dei datori di lavoro previsti dalla normativa vigente ambito preventivo primis garantendo un informazione e una formazione dei lavoratori sui rischi occupazionali di elevata qualit la recente comparsa nel panorama della medicina occupazionale di rischi non tradizionali ambito sanitario rammenta la necessit di un costante aggiornamento sul tema fine di tutelare le categorie occupazionali maggior rischio consolidando una vera e propria cultura della prevenzione ambito sanitario gli studenti infatti devono fronteggiare non solo eventi stressanti dal fortissimo impatto emotivo frequenti nella quotidianit ospedaliera sono anche costantemente posti sotto pressione dal percorso universitario da un lato l enorme carico di studio e le scadenze puntuali delle sessioni esami dall altro il poco tempo libero risparmiato da studi e tirocini che spesso impedisce l adozione di comportamenti e abitudini come sport hobby che svolgono un ruolo protettivo nei confronti dello stress inoltre spesso gli studenti devono affrontare difficolt economiche e per la prima volta la lontananza dalla famiglia causa di un test di ingresso con graduatoria nazionale che alcuni casi rende necessario il trasferimento un altra regione l insieme di questi fattori genus negli studenti sintomi depressivi con una compromissione fisica emotiva e cognitiva delle loro capacit l esito spesso un peggioramento dei risultati accademici oltre che un peggioramento della qualit dell attivit assistenziale con scarsa comunicazione e aumento degli errori medici questo instaura un circolo vizioso che tende cronicizzare il test di ingresso inizio carriera voti conseguiti agli esami e la consapevolezza di dover affrontare una volta laureati un ulteriore difficile test selettivo per le borse di specializzazione che porr nuovamente gli studenti gli uni contro gli altri contribuiscono creare un ambiente quasi sempre competitivo e volta propriamente ostile questa situazione sua volta porta gli studenti nascondere le difficolt per la paura di stigmatizzazione di esclusione di mostrarsi deboli questo contesto gli studenti di medicina tendono non cercare il giusto supporto nella propria rete sociale rivolgersi specialisti quali psicologi e psichiatri l esito finale di questi fenomeni pu essere molto grave e volta irreversibile oltre burnout ed abuso di sostanze range degli studenti ha riferito ideazione suicidaria durante l universit la prevalenza di questo fenomeno la sua gravit e probabili effetti negativi sulla qualit di vita degli studenti rendono necessaria una approfondita analisi del fenomeno anche contesto italiano modo da individuare fattori implicati pi importanti e se possibile sottopopolazioni rischio fine di implementare efficaci misure preventive e di trattamento principali limiti di questo studio includono la struttura crosssectional la quale circoscrive possibili interpretazioni causali e rende difficile comprendere se alcuni fattori portino depressione ad esempio oppure l associazione sia dovuta pensiero negativo tipico di questa malattia gli strumenti auto compilati rispetto interviste strutturate e diagnosi cliniche inoltre causa del campionamento opportunistico non stato possibile raccogliere dati relativamente agli studenti che non hanno voluto partecipare allo studio che non erano presenti lezione causando una potenziale perdita di informazioni importanti il presente studio ha mostrato come gli studenti di medicina italiani siano rischio di depressione e di ideazione suicidaria con delle prevalenze paragonabili quelle degli studenti di medicina di tutto il mondo questa popolazione risulta inoltre fortemente rischio di sviluppare livelli di stress molto elevati cui spesso le risorse cognitive emotive sociali non riescono far fronte instaurando circoli viziosi che rischiano di protrarsi fino percorso di formazione specialistica e attivit di specialista le scuole di medicina dovrebbero compiere degli sforzi per pianificare e implementare strategie preventive e di cura sia offrendo un servizio di supporto psicologico sia lavorando su fattori di rischio potenzialmente modificabili la sanit pubblica livello globale deve oggi affrontare molteplici sfide per fornire servizi sanitari efficienti adeguati e di elevata qualit costi accessibili diverse ricerche e attivit ambito sanitario sono oggi disponibili per supportare le politiche di sanit pubblica e il processo decisionale clinico allo scopo da un lato di organizzare servizi sanitari modo efficace ed efficiente e migliorare le prestazioni dei sistemi sanitari nonch la qualit dell assistenza sanitarium e dall altro di ridurre gli sprechi disinvestire sulle prestazioni pratiche sanitarie inefficaci e inappropriate e riallocare le risorse verso le attivit maggiore valore grado di produrre migliori risultati terminus di salute realt affrontare il problema della produzione di prestazioni pratiche inutili che addirittura espongono pazienti poten ziali rischi un esigenza percepita una molteplicit di contesti internazionali partire da quello statunitense dove gi da anni stata posta la domanda better tal senso nell ultimo decennio si sono moltiplicate le iniziative mirate promuovere una sanit parsimoniosa che garantisca un assistenza appropriata e che corrisponda alle necessit e ai bisogni dei pazienti da campagne come much medicine promossa dal british medical journal alle attivit correlate movimento che si ispira le conferenze e dibattiti su overdiagnosis e sovratrattamento fino recenti programmi come ad esempio quello sulla prudent healthcare promosso dal governo gallese nazionale preventiva e sanit pubblica con il gruppo di lavoro gisio gruppo italiano studio igiene ospedaliera hanno promosso il progetto intersocietario choosing wisely igiene ospedaliera per il contrasto alle infezioni correlate assistenza ica e particolare antimicrobico resistenza amr mediante l identificazione di best practice da monitorare e promuovere un contesto nazionale partendo dalla consapevolezza delle nostre specificit sulla base delle evidenze scientifiche disponibili sono state individuate cinque pratiche da monitorare capaci di orientare e influenzare comportamenti e le scelte degli operatori e delle organizzazioni con appropriati indicatori particolare sono state identificate le seguenti pratiche inappropriate utilizzo dei guanti monouso sostituzione dell igiene delle mani e mancato utilizzo della soluzione idroalcolica ii e iii somministrazione anticipata della profilassi antibiotica perioperatoria pap e la sua eccessiva durata iv ingiustificata apertura delle porte delle sale operatorie e v mancata segnalazione nella lettera di dimissione documento di trasferimento della positivit per microrganismi alert dei pazienti per ciascuna delle pratiche stato predisposto un protocollo operativo con le indicazioni per la misura e relativi indicatori per il loro monitoraggio nonch delle apposite schede gestite mediante un sistema informativo web based per la raccolta dei dati dai centri partecipanti livello nazionale il progetto ha coinvolto mediante componenti del gisio siti e di anmdo molteplici istituzioni sanitarie seguendo l ottica del movimento choosing wisely mirato ad aumentare l efficacia e l efficienza degli interventi di riduzione del rischio infettivo pertanto tramite componenti del gisio le strutture sanitarie livello nazionale sono state invitate partecipare prima ad uno studio pilota proseguito successivamente con uno studio tuttora corso complessivamente hanno finora aderito progetto strutture sanitarie pubbliche e private il monitoraggio delle pratiche di igiene delle mani e dell utilizzo dei guanti stato effettuato utilizzando metodi e gli strumenti validati dall oms metodi diretto e indiretto modificati per permettere la valutazione dell utilizzo dei guanti mediante l osservazione delle opportunit di igiene delle mani e identificazione di quelle occasione delle quali gli operatori sanitari sostituiscono l igiene delle mani con l uso dei guanti risultati del progetto confermano l italia tra paesi europei con il pi basso consumo di soluzione idroalcolica giorni di degenza consumo inferiore allo standard raccomandato dall oms inoltre evidenziano un adesione complessiva igiene delle mani del con un livello di compliance che varia tra le diverse categorie professionali tale percentuale simile quella riportata dalla survey della oms condotta nel circa e conferma dati della campagna clean care safer care condotta italia nel inoltre la non adesione igiene delle mani con l uso dei guanti risultata pari circa il con percentuali differenti tra le diverse categorie professionali l importanza dell appropriata profilassi antibiotica perioperatoria pap per la prevenzione delle infezioni del sito chirurgico isc stata confermata da diversi studi epidemiologi inoltre il suo utilizzo inappropriato contribuisce notevolmente consumo totale di antibiotici negli ospedali ed stato associato aumento della resistenza agli antibiotici dei microrganismi risultati del progetto choosing wisely igiene ospedaliera evidenziano elevate percentuali di non compliance alle raccomandazioni internazionali relativamente momento di somministrazione della pap e alla sua durata identificando ampi margini di miglioramento le strategie di prevenzione delle isc prevedono anche interventi per garantire la qualit dell aria nella sala operatoria l apertura delle porte pu compromettere l efficacia degli impianti di ventilazione determinando un incremento del rischio di isc anche per questa procedura risultati del progetto confermano elevati livelli di inappropriatezza le pi importanti istituzioni internazionali tema di gestione e controllo dell amr e dei microrganismi multiresistenti mdro hanno evidenziato che tra l ampia variet di interventi di controllo delle ica da mdro indispensabile la documentazione dello stato di paziente positivo quando questo viene dimesso trasferito un altro reparto un altra struttura sanitarium risultati del progetto choosing wisely igiene ospedaliera riportano che per pazienti positivi ai microrganismi alert inclusi la frequenza di segnalazione nella lettera di dimissione nel documento di trasferimento altra struttura complessivamente pari circa il requisito fondamentale per il successo di efficaci strategie di controllo e prevenzione delle ica e per il contrasto amr l utilizzo di una metodologia standardizzata e di indicatori validi per il monitoraggio delle pratiche modo da indirizzare e sostenerne il miglioramento nel tempo risultati del progetto consentono di evidenziare particolari target su cui indirizzare talus interventi per contrastare l inappropriatezza delle pratiche e migliorare l assistenza con questo spirito il gruppo di lavoro si quindi prefissato di effettuare una attivit che non fosse la ricerca di elementi di novit produzione di ulteriori evidenze scientifiche e nemmeno solo cassa di risonanza per pratiche gi largamente note e sostenute da ampia letteratura scientifica di perseguire una linea di azione standardizzata orientata alla possibilit di migliorare effettivamente la situazione del contesto nazionale ancora oggi caratterizzata da differenze quali quantitative tra le regioni nell ambito dei servizi e delle prestazioni erogati e che proprio per questo ha notevoli margini di miglioramento la sala operatoria uno degli ambienti assistenziali maggior rischio di infezione e l infezione del sito chirurgico isc la pi frequente complicanza dell intervento chirurgico con un aumento di morbosit mortalit e notevole aggravio di costi l aria rappresenta un importante veicolo di isc particolare negli interventi puliti e specialmente quelli con impianto di protesi la carica microbica livello del sito chirurgico il necessario precursore della successiva infezione microrganismi presenti nell aria possono raggiungere il sito chirurgico sia depositandosi direttamente su di esso sia indirettamente dopo essersi depositati su altre superfici come strumenti chirurgici telini mani dei chirurghi la principale misura di prevenzione delle isc di origine aerea l installazione di impianti di ventilazione e condizionamento contaminazione controllata vccc flusso aria turbolento unidirezionale la sala operatoria pertanto un ambiente contaminazione controllata cio un ambiente cui la concentrazione di particelle aerotrasportate controllata e che costruito e utilizzato modo da minimizzare l introduzione la generazione e la ritenzione di particelle suo interno e cui altri parametri pertinenti come temperatura umidit e pressione sono controllati seconda delle necessit tuttavia diversi fattori possono influenzare la carica microbica dell aria le persone sono la principale sorgente di contaminazione ambienti confinati per cui il mancato utilizzo lo scorretto utilizzo dei dispositivi di protezione individuale il muoversi il parlare portano ad un aumento della dispersione dei microrganismi da cute e mucose le continue aperture di porte determinano alterazioni del flussso aria e favoriscono l ingresso dei microrganismi da ambienti adiacenti e lo stesso impianto vccc se non ben gestito pu diventare un pericoloso fomite di infezione pertanto l aver installato un impianto vccc non garanzia di bassa carica microbica dell aria diventa quindi fondamentale verificare che tutti fattori associati aumento della contaminazione microbica dell aria siano strettamente controllati e che la qualit dell aria corrisponda quanto atteso con il tipo di impianto vccc che stato installato tale contesto il

ospedaliera della siti societ italiana di igiene medicina preventiva e sanit pubblica sale operatorie flusso turbolento stato registrato un valore mediano di cfu riposo e di ufc durante l attivit chirurgica stato quindi ragionevole l abbassamento del valore soglia di contaminazione microbica dell aria sala operatoria riposo cfu mentre il valore soglia di cfu durante l attivit chirurgica rimasto invariato porterebbe una sottostima del rischio bisogna tener presente inoltre che considerando la variabilit dei risultati ottenuti con diversi campionatori e il gran numero di campionatori oggi disponibili la definizione di uno standard richiederebbe l indicazione anche del campionatore da utilizzare tale proposito le linee guida sulla prevenzione e sicurezza nelle sale operatorie del della regione lombardia sottolineavano la variabilit dei risultati ottenuti con diversi campionatori e raccomandavano di realizzare uno studio preliminare che permetta di fissare una soglia critica di contaminazione le malattie infettive nel corso dei secoli hanno avuto un profondo impatto non solo sulla salute umana anche sulla storia della specie influenzando l esito di guerre nonch il destino di nazioni ed imperi differenza della stragrande maggioranza delle malattie cronico degenerative la cui eziologia complessa e multifattoriale le malattie infettive sono genere causate dall azione di un unico agente biologico la cui identificazione permette di attuare idonee misure di controllo sia generiche igiene personale e ambientale disinfezione controllo dei vettori che specifiche vaccinazione e terapia antimicrobica tali misure hanno avuto un tale successo si pensi solo alla campagna di eradicazione del vaiolo che almeno nei paesi industrializzati ne derivata la convinzione che le malattie infettive fossero ormai prossime ad essere definitivamente sconfitte co che sul finire degli anni il surgeon general la massima autorit sanitarium statunitense annunci time close book infectious disease war pestilence ha tale affermazione sembrava indubbiamente destinata spostare l attenzione e le priorit verso le malattie cronico degenerative del resto malattie cardiovascolari ischemiche e l ictus le malattie polmonari cronico ostruttiva risultano essere ormai le tre principali cause di morte nel mondo oltre ai tumori che vengono presentati forma disaggregata nelle graduatorie che tengono conto del tipo specifico di diagnosi altres vero che ancor oggi fra le pi frequenti cause di morte livello globale figurano le infezioni delle basse vie respiratorie le diarree e la tubercolosi quindi distanza di quasi mezzo secolo le malattie infettive rappresentano un rilevante determinante di mortalit inoltre se si restringe il campo ai paesi poveri di risorse oltre alle infezioni alle basse vie respiratorie alle diverse forme di diarrea e alla tubercolosi troviamo certamente l hiv aids e la malaria infine se si considera la mortalit infantile decesso anni nelle prime posizioni troviamo la polmonite la sepsi neonatale le diarree e la malaria non sono solo le malattie infettive tradizionali giocare un ruolo ancora importante per quanto riguarda la morbidit e la mortalit quanto negli ultimi decenni abbiamo assistito con sempre maggior frequenza fenomeno delle infezioni emergenti causate per lo pi da passaggi di specie da reservoir animali uomo con successivo adattamento di agenti patogeni quasi sempre di natura virale cambiamenti demografici e ambientali inclusi cambiamenti climatici e l urbanizzazione sono tutti fattori che possono poi contribuire alla diffusione di talus agenti patogeni tra virus emersi identificati negli ultimi anni ricordiamo ebola e marburg nipah hiv sars coronavirus virus dell influenza aviaria da il virus dell influenza di origine suina mers coronavirus altri virus come quelli dell influenza umana vanno incontro ad un continuo processo di mutazione e selezione per cui sono grado di evadere le risposte immunitarie e provocare epidemie ogni anno inoltre virus come dengue zika e chikungunya la cui nicchia ecologica era geograficamente ristretta hanno invece espanso la propria area di attivit conquistando nuove terre e nuovi continenti seguito delle loro zanzare vettrici altre malattie infettive che sembravano destinate ad esser poste sotto controllo sono ricomparse hanno ripreso una pi intensa attivit un esempio fra tutti quello della tubercolosi una classica infezione riemergente causa del loro potenziale epidemico talus infezioni rappresentano una costante minaccia per l umanit ed quindi fondamentale contrastarle con attivit di ricerca sorveglianza prevenzione e controllo infine il fenomeno della resistenza antimicrobica rischia di mettere repentaglio la medicina moderna nel suo insieme rendendo difficilmente curabili non curabili affatto un ampia gamma di infezioni soprattutto quelle associate assistenza ambito ospedaliero e nelle lungodegenze germi multiresistenti agli antibiotici come ad esempio le klebsielle l ultimo allarme questo proposito riguarda la cosiddetta new delhi hanno invaso le corsie di molti ospedali italiani soprattutto le terapie intensive laddove si trovano pazienti fragili sottoposti frequenti procedure invasive il sempre pi frequente ricorso ospedalizzazione associato invecchiamento della popolazione contribuisce certamente ad aumentare le dimensioni del problema che pu essere contenuto mediante un uso prudente degli antibiotici e la costante applicazione di appropriate misure di igiene ospedaliera fortunatamente l uso di vaccini sempre pi efficaci ha determinato globalmente una diminuzione del carico di malattia contenendo la diffusione di patologie potenzialmente letali quali tetano difterite importanti successi sono stati ottenuti anche nei confronti di malattie batteriche invasive quali quelle da pneumococco emofilo e meningococco e di infezioni associate tumori prime fra tutte hbv e hpv infine un flagello come la poliomielite ormai ristretto un limitato numero di paesi la lotta contro le malattie infettive vecchie e nuove quindi lungi dall essere vinta anche se importanti passi avanti sono stati fatti nel corso dell ultimo secolo per questo importante un impegno continuo da parte della sanit pubblica fine di rafforzare programmi di sorveglianza e controllo sia livello nazionale che globale per un efficace contrasto delle malattie infettive la conoscenza di come dove e che misura ogni singola malattia sia presente uno specifico ambito territoriale un indispensabile prerequisito e questo lo specifico campo di azione della sorveglianza sebbene l idea di utilizzare dati di morbilit e mortalit per il controllo e il contrasto delle malattie infettive affondi le sue radice nell italia dei comuni e delle signorie e l obbligo di notifica gi introdotto alla fine del secolo xix abbia avuto la codifica attuale nel con il testo unico delle leggi sanitarie dobbiamo far risalire la attuale concetto scientifico di sorveglianza immediato dopoguerra con l avvio dei programmi nazionale ed interazionali di controllo delle principali malattie infettive ed particolare della malaria e la nascita delle principiali agenzie governative cdc ed internazionali si inizi allora definire sorveglianza la raccolta e l analisi dei dati di mortalit e morbilit e nel alexander langmuir chief epidemiologist dell allora comunicable

esempio le azioni di profilassi e di lotta ai vettori per la malaria e le vaccinazioni per il morbillo e la polio il termine sorveglianza divenne quindi nel tempo sinonimo di contenimento ongoing

dei malati oncologici e cronici nel polo pi vicino alla zona di residenza indipendentemente dalla asl di residenza e dall ospedale di riferimento limitando gli spostamenti l attivazione di servizi pediatrici dalla diagnostica per immagini consulenze specialistiche con operatori dell ircss gaslini e l attivazione del diar dipartimento interaziendale regionale materno infantile per tutti bisogni della prima infanzia e delle donne il potenziamento dei servizi di cure domiciliari e integrazioni di attivit infermieristiche riabilitative sociosanitarie ostetriche e gestione domiciliare delle patologie croniche la richiesta la disponibilit e collaborazione da parte delle farmacie per la gestione dei presidi e quindi una riduzione degli accessi fisici nelle strutture sanitarie numeri telefonici dedicati utenza e agli operatori per le informazioni riguardanti apertu ra di ambulatori e riorganizzazione degli ambulatori e infine la ricollocazione e la logistica del personale del sistema sanitario regionale la asl sistema sanitario regione liguria sulla base delle azioni proposte livello regionale ha riorganizzato le risorse spostando e ampliando servizi verso tre distretti socio sanitari collegati dal ponte morandi per salvaguardare livelli essenziali di assistenza e la tutela della salute quale diritto costituzionalmente riconosciuto e attivando numeri di telefono

migliorativi iniziati di recente come l introduzione del sollecitone per lo screening della cervice un secondo sollecito anni dal primo e che sar valutato ad un anno dall introduzione il nuovo piano nazionale della prevenzione vaccinale pnpv sottolinea l importanza di sviluppare una rete organizzativa grado di rafforzare l attivit vaccinale gratuita e obbligatoria raccomandata per raggiungere gli obiettivi indicati dal ministero della salute inoltre la legge luglio conversione legge con modificazioni del decreto legge giugno recante disposizioni urgenti materia di prevenzione vaccinale rende cogenti gli aspetti della raccolta dati sulla situazione vaccinale degli operatori scolastici sanitari e socio sanitari l implementazione dei servizi vaccinali passa anche dall introduzione di nuove modalit di offerta con modalit e luoghi sempre pi adatti promuovere e attuare la prevenzione immunologica un luogo nel quale possiamo trovare pi categorie di soggetti rischio e quindi per quali prioritaria una protezione vaccinale adeguata l ospedale un ambulatorio vaccinale ospedaliero pu intercettare modo efficace operatori sanitari pazienti utenti e visitatori anche un ottica di medicina di opportunit e di iniziativa per poter rispondere alla carenza di offerta vaccinale nei confronti delle fasce di pi adulte l ambulatorio per la medicina dei viaggiatori attivo tutte le asl pu rappresentare un primo importante punto di riferimento un concreto passo per creare ogni asl una rete integrata di servizi vaccinali non solo per l infanzia che pu rappresentare un valido contributo per aumentare le coperture vaccinali nelle fasce di nelle quali si manifesta il maggior numero di patologie infettive prevenibili con vaccino tutti vaccini possono provocare delle reazioni avverse le quali possono essere classificate tre grandi categorie locali sistemiche e di tipo allergico le reazioni locali sono quelle generalmente pi frequenti e sono le meno gravi le reazioni sistemiche come ad e la febbre occorrono con minore frequenza rispetto alle reazioni locali le reazioni avverse gravi sono invece fortunatamente rare fra queste le reazioni allergiche gravi angioedema orticaria generalizzata fino allo shock sono gli eventi pi gravi fortunatamente anche meno frequenti il punto cruciale per evitare le reazioni avverse il controllo prevaccinale ogni medico che somministra dei vaccini deve sempre eseguire una valutazione preventiva del vaccinando alla ricerca di controindicazioni e precauzioni quella vaccinazione prima della somministrazione anche attraverso l uso di apposite check list le azioni comunicative per la salute pubblica variano notevolmente per argomento di interesse attivit condotte progettazione e modalit di esecuzione co come variano ampiamente le modalit di studio condotte per valutarne l efficacia e la costo efficacia limiti evidenziati sono ampiamenti diffusi e rappresentano la prossima sfida per rafforzare le attivit di valutazione delle azioni di comunicazione che dovrebbe comprendere quando possibile le analisi di costo efficacia ed essere integrata tutte le fasi della campagna dalla programmazione alla sua implementazione lo sviluppo di evidenza di alto livello questo campo essenziale per guidare la scelta di politiche e azioni efficaci ed efficienti evitando la dispersione di risorse umane ed economiche nonch potenziali ricadute negative terminus di outcome di salute la sfida successiva sar poi quella di sviluppare adeguate capacit per mettere piedi programmi di valutazione nazionali grado di applicare le migliori evidenze alla valutazione delle azioni di comunicazione sanit pubblica analogamente allo studio generale per l italia stato dimostrato che due dosi di vaccino mmrv somministrate durante il secondo

impatto positivo sull uptake della vaccinazione particolar modo attraverso interventi di remind gli interventi e contesti cui essi venivano sperimentati sono risultati tuttavia molto eterogenei suggerendo l importanza di adattare talus iniziative allo specifico contesto fine di massimizzarne l impatto considerate le differenze nucleotidiche e aminoacidiche tra due sottogruppi l ev stata

nati pretermine partire dalla settimana di vita risultati termine del triennio di attivit permetteranno futuro di migliorare la fiducia degli operatori sanitari sull efficacia e sicurezza della vaccinazione anti rv con l obiettivo di migliorare le coperture vaccinali anti rotavirus le malattie rare hanno rappresentato per molto tempo una falsa controindicazione alla vaccinazione soprattutto per la mancanza di raccomandazioni sulle eventuali precauzioni da adottare prima della somministrazione dei vaccini l attivazione di un ambulatorio specialistico ha fornito chiare indicazioni agli operatori che hanno preso carico questi pazienti fragili e ha consentito di rassicurare futuri genitori sulla sicurezza delle vaccinazioni migliorandone la compliance questi pazienti infatti rappresentano spesso un sottogruppo di popolazione cui le vaccinazioni dovrebbero essere offerte prioritariamente anche nella popolazione pediatrica l efficacia vaccinale risulta condizionata dalla variabilit genetica dei virus circolanti nelle stagioni cui l omologia genetica tra virus e vaccini si conservata l efficacia risultata elevata ci potrebbe giustificare l estensione della proposta attiva della vaccinazione nei bambino sani con l intento di proteggere questa fascia di e tutti loro contatti le microplastiche g rilevate nei vegetali si attestano molto elevate campioni km zero hanno mostrato una minore contaminazione g da microplastiche caratterizzate da diametri maggiori rispetto agli altri campioni le lattughe appaiono pi contaminate rispetto alle mele tale dato pu essere spiegato dalla maggiore difficolt di traslocazione delle microplastiche nelle parti aeree delle piante dalla compartimentalizzazione delle stesse nelle parti ipogee necessiter verificare tale ipotesi con analisi pi dettagliate radici culmo foglie e frutti tale evidenza chiarisce che possibile realizzare un metodo di fitoestrazione per la bonifica dei suoli da microplastiche per la prima volta

con la mortalit per tutte le cause e specifica questo studio condotto su tutti comuni della regione sicilia sottolinea la necessit di un continuo monitoraggio dell urban sprawl fine di valutarne l evoluzione nel tempo e la relazione con un importante outcome di salute come la mortalit cardiovascolare le nostre analisi evidenziano una importante associazione con la mortalit cardiovascolare anche se sarebbe necessario correggere per fattori legati allo stile di vita che non sono disponibili livello dei comuni siciliani l individuazione di un indice di sprawl utile nel fornire un evidenza ai policymakers per individuare e supportare le strategie e le azioni da implementare per migliorare la qualit della vita nelle aree urbane con un approccio multisettoriale nel campione studiato l occupazione ambito sanitario non influisce sulla scelta di vaccinare propri figli la presenza di operatori sanitari nel gruppo degli esitanti e nel gruppo dei non vaccinatori rappresenta un forte ostacolo alla diffusione di una corretta cultura vaccinale quanto sostiene e rafforza la scelta di questi genitori gli esitanti e misura maggiore non vaccinatori cercano supporto personale sanitario per lo pi esterno ssn appare utile uno studio mirato ad approfondire opinioni ed atteggiamenti rispetto alla pratica vaccinale degli operatori sanitari che operano diversi contesti che permetta

della provincia di brescia risultati di questo studio di coorte mostrano una tendenza del sesso femminile presentare maggiori disagi nell ambito della salute mentale alcuni stili di vita errati sono relativamente comuni un quinto degli studenti ha fumato nel mese precedente con percentuali simili tra maschi e femmine mentre il consumo di alcolici pi diffuso tra maschi considerazione della mancanza di anonimato dei questionari e diritto dei genitori su richiesta di prendere visione delle informazioni raccolte non possibile escludere che vi siano bias di selezione del campione di risposte questionario adulti e l efficacia dell intervento svolto con tecniche innovative di comunicazione che sono state molto apprezzate da studenti ed insegnanti ha determinato l estensione per l

relativo uso di dd nei bambino considerando l ampio utilizzo dei dd negli adulti e di conseguenza nei bambino particolare attenzione deve essere rivolta tale problema da parte della sanit pubblica sarebbe auspicabile incrementare interventi di divulgazione sensibilizzazione che guidino un utilizzo consapevole di questi dispositivi lo studio dimostra che soggetti di sesso femminile essere affetti da una malattia cronica ed avere una bassa percezione del proprio stato di salute costituiscono tutti fattori che possono aumentare il rischio di sviluppare sintomi depressivi di contro una regolare attivit fisica l amicizia e le relazioni possono essere considerate fattori che proteggono dal rischio di imbattersi nella sintomatologia depressiva che pu compromettere sia lo studio che le

sulla salute pubblica e su loro stessi rivolgendo particolare attenzione alle classi rappresentate dal sesso femminile con una inferiore anni il progetto dipartimento senza fumo costituisce un intervento che va oltre il mero rispetto della legge e che ha come obiettivo principale la promozione della salute e il rispetto dell ambiente esperienze simili sono gi atto altri paesi e alcune universit stanno addirittura promuovendo campus smoke free se questo progetto coinvolger altri dipartimenti dell ateneo con un effetto domino l universit sapienza potrebbe promuovere la salute maniera concreta e trasversale per tutti gli studenti indipendentemente dai loro percorsi di studio per tutto il personale e per tutti gli utenti risultati preliminari del questionario di valutazione iniziale hanno evidenziato interesse verso una proposta di movimenti durante le pause di attesa un contesto cui le opportunit per svolgere attivit fisica vanno diminuendo e la prevalenza della sedentariet ha raggiunto livelli elevati il progetto proposto con l offerta di un opportunit facilmente accessibile nei diversi contesti di vita e per tutte le fasce rappresenta un contributo alla promozione dell attivit fisica favorendo processi di empowerment attraverso la sensibilizzazione verso uno stile di vita attivo la valutazione del rischio microbiologico ha un ruolo centrale per la gestione della qualit delle acque di balneazione l approccio pi semplice la valutazione del contesto consistente ispezioni sanitarie e nel rispetto dei limiti degli indicatori batterici di inquinamento fecale lgs un altro metodo di valutazione prevede la costruzione di matrici di rischio sulla base della probabilit dell evento dannoso e della sua gravit infine la qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment stima il rischio corrispondente ad un contesto ad una matrice modo quantitativo tale metodologia fornisce un approccio sistematico utilizzo dei dati scientifici per la gestione del rischio e per stabilire le priorit delle azioni di controllo sebbene raccomandata dall oms ad oggi la qmra non ha ancora trovato applicazione italia lo sviluppo della qmra acque ricreative stato oggetto del progetto ccm che ha previsto lo studio di aree di balneazione accomunate dalla presenza di corsi acqua come fonte di inquinamento fecale nell ambito del progetto stato costruito un modello qmra stocastico per stimare il rischio di gastroenteriti per singola esposizione poi applicato tre localit balneari sulla costa tirrenica toscana e lazio e adriatica emilia romagna sono stati selezionati quattro patogeni indice base alla loro rilevanza epidemiologica le concentrazioni dei patogeni sono state ottenute partire dalle concentrazioni di e coli derivanti dal monitoraggio istituzionale il livello di esposizione ingestione attraverso la balneazione e le curve dose risposta equazioni e parametri sono stati ricavati dalla letteratura scientifica modelli per ciascun patogeno sono stati eseguiti con metodo monte carlo iterazioni poi unificati con una produttoria per evidenziare l importanza relativa delle diverse variabili nella stima del rischio stata effettuata una sensitivity analysis mediamente il rischio di gastroenterite risulta di casi di gastroenterite ogni esposizioni attivit balneari toscana emilia romagna e nel lazio risultati mostrano la predominanza della probabilit di malattia dovute norovirus dalla sensitivity analysis emerso come le variabili pi influenti nella stima del rischio siano fattori di conversione da e coli nov e salmonella il modello costruito potr essere applicato alla gestione di specifiche situazioni di rischio tuttavia bisogni di ricerca questo ambito sono ancora numerosi tra quali la necessit di dati di monitoraggio sui patogeni e dati della sorveglianza epidemiologica per comprendere principali agenti eziologici delle gastroenteriti associate alle acque di balneazione nelle aree di studio sebbene il genotipo di cryptosporidium riscontrato non sia patogeno per l uomo la sua presenza dimostra l inefficacia dei trattamenti di potabilizzazione impiegati nell abbattimento delle oocisti evidenziando co un potenziale rischio per la popolazione residente pertanto questi risultati sottolineano la necessit di monitorare costantemente la presenza di oocisti nelle aree rurali anche nei paesi industrializzati e con alti standard igienico sanitari l approccio della gwf per lo studio della qualit delle acque sotterranee ha consentito di individuare le aree maggiormente compromesse relazione inquinamento da nitrati e le attivit responsabili di tale impatto permettendo di ottenere informazioni supplementari che non potrebbero essere ricavate considerando esclusivamente superamenti dei limiti normativi l impronta idrica grigia pertanto potrebbe essere concepita come un indicatore utile per processi di pianificazione delle politiche agricole per stabilire una migliore gestione dell uso del suolo nostri risultati evidenziano che l azione dello spazzolamento meccanico e la rimozione delle polveri associato alla microaerosolizzazione del perossido di idrogeno favorisce l eliminazione totale di batteri e miceti dalle condotte aerauliche ulteriori studi potranno confermare che la corretta pulizia e sanificazione delle condotte aerauliche costituiscono requisiti irrinunciabili per la tutela della salute pubblica risultati indicano la necessit di interventi di educazione sanitarium per aumentare le conoscenze terminus di peggioramento della qualit dell aria indoor negli ambienti di vita e di lavoro cui vengono utilizzati dispositivi monitorati test con v fischeri e magna sono influenzati dal numero di cellule di cianobatteri piuttosto che alla concentrazione di tossine infatti l inibizione della luminosit emessa da v fischeri co come la riproduzione di magna cresce con l aumento del numero di cellule di cianobatteri invece il saggio di platyurus mostra una correlazione positiva con le concentrazioni di microcistine l esecuzione combinata dei test con v fischeri e platyurus potrebbe rappresentare un utile strumento per il monitoraggio delle acque sia dal punto di vista economico che tecnico risultati evidenziano che sono necessari interventi di promozione della salute per aumentare le conoscenze degli utilizzatori terminus di peggioramento della qualit dell aria indoor quando viene usata l e cig inoltre sono altrettanto necessari interventi legislativi per regolare l uso delle e cigs luoghi pubblici e altri ambienti chiusi fine di proteggere la salute di qualsiasi soggetto potenzialmente esposto modo passivo dati ottenuti con due metodi sono risultati coerenti tra loro entrambi gli strumenti evidenziano una forte relazione tra il design dell ambiente costruito e la sicurezza percepita dai residenti sottolineando la necessit di migliorare alcuni parametri quali l illuminazione della strada la protezione dalla velocit veicolare e gli attraversamenti pedonali il questionario pu essere ulteriormente semplificato ai fini di una pi rapida ed efficace applicazione il monitoraggio dei contaminanti ambientali tossici genotossici cancerogeni e interferenti endocrini presenti negli effluenti degli impianti di depurazione mediante un approccio integrato applicando diversi test differenti tipi cellulari permette una migliore valutazione dell impatto sull ambiente e della possibile esposizione umana composti pericolosi per la salute la modellizzazione di questi dati potrebbe essere un utile ausilio per gestori degli impianti di trattamento finanziato dall universit di brescia

thermomyces per funghi potrebbero essere proposti come bioindicatori per la valutazione di routine della contaminazione da bioaerosol negli impianti di compostaggio sia la contaminazione da bioaerosol che da pm sottile costituiscono importanti fattori di rischio per la salute umana nella filiera del trattamento dei rifiuti organici e necessitano di un accurata valutazione e gestione il programma di controllo regionale indirizzato modo da coprire una porzione significativa di popolazione laziale e nel si estender ad altre zdf co da coprire tutta la regione controlli interni e esterni distribuiti uniformemente garantiscono che valori ottenuti siano rappresentativi della qualit utilizzata infine il programma ha ottenuto il parere favorevole del ministero della salute espresso tramite l organo tecnico iss risultati ottenuti dal presente studio sebbene preliminari hanno evidenziato un efficace azione di bonifica ambientale che se confermata da ulteriori studi potrebbe essere impiegata come strumento di prevenzione ambienti indoor soprattutto dove processi di disinfezione possono risultare particolarmente complessi il presente studio ha permesso di ottenere una istantanea circa lo stato

anche gruppi di popolazione rischio sia per che per patologia le caratteristiche cliniche ed epidemiologiche dei casi sono risultate concordi con dati di letteratura ad eccezione della frequenza dei casi associati alla gravidanza inferiore rispetto atteso risultati ottenuti hanno documentato un incidenza della patologia regione lombardia tutt altro che trascurabile sottolineando quindi la necessit di potenziare il collegamento tra due sistemi di sorveglianza attualmente indipendenti tra loro fine di ridurre la quota di casi persi e favorire un pi rapido e tempestivo riconoscimento degli eventi epidemici la disponibilit di sistemi di sorveglianza epidemiologica e virologica integrati grado di caratterizzare patogeni respiratori circolanti causa di ari rappresenta un elemento chiave per comprendere l epidemiologia di questi virus e valutare la fattibilit e l efficacia di strategie preventive e terapeutiche innovative il nostro studio mostra il successo della strategia di

direzione di quelli attesi dal modello di intervento nonostante la dose di esercizi e training cognitivi e comportamentali sia stata drasticamente ridimensionata per inserirsi negli spazi limitati ottenuti per l intervento negli orari e nella normale organizzazione della didattica da una prima analisi dei dati si individua un livello di stress percepito generalmente alto il campione si trova spesso insoddisfatto della propria vita delle proprie scelte difficolt nell affrontare le problematiche quotidiane quando si tratta da valutare la qualit della vita la maggior parte non si ritiene soddisfatto insoddisfatto con una variabile frequenza delle risposte agli estremi molto soddisfatto molto insoddisfatto dividendo il campione tra maschi e femmine si inoltre evidenziato che le donne hanno un valore di stress percepito pi alto rispetto agli uomini ed hanno minore fiducia nella propria capacit di superare le avversit della vita quotidiana risultati del nostro studio hanno messo evidenza che solo un terzo della popolazione indagata aveva una buona aderenza alla dieta mediterranea e quindi buone conoscenze nutrizionali pertanto considerazione delle implicazioni che questo comporta anche terminus di ricaduta sui figli auspicabile che siano implementati interventi volti miglioramento delle conoscenze nutrizionali delle mamme per promuovere la scelta di cibi salutari e buone abitudini alimentari l educazione alla salute e la promozione di stili di vita salutari possono essere proposti fin dalla primissima infanzia nei contesti educativi si possono realizzare attivit rivolte sia ai bambino che ai loro genitori con l obiettivo di prevenire malattie legate alla cattiva alimentazione ed allo scarso movimento fisico risultati permetteranno di ottenere una pi precisa stima delle conoscenze e attitudini del personale sanitario e valuteranno l opportunit di successiva realizzazione di eventi formativi rivolti agli stessi operatori sanitari con l obiettivo di colmare

oncologici la simulazione condotta questo studio sembra confermare che quando si valutano malattie con tassi di incidenza si possono trovare differenze significative imputabili ad inaccuratezza nella stima della numerosit della popolazione va notato che l istat ha chiarito che tra il e il la variabilit delle dimensioni della popolazione potrebbe essere attribuibile ad alcune discrepanze tra dati del censimento e popolazione legale dei comuni il presente studio evidenzia pertanto che negli studi epidemiologici l attenzione rivolta accertamento dell accuratezza del numeratore non pu essere considerata sufficiente garantire stime accurate quando denominatori sono fluttuanti e potenzialmente inaccurati disordini alimentari sono un problema attuale e importante il mondo affronta una epidemia di obesit specie paesi ad alto reddito per cui il monitoraggio continuo nella popolazione generale e interventi atti modificare comportamenti individuali rappresentano misure fondamentali di

per definire il territorio su cui intervenire dati della sorveglianza hanno evidenziato come gli ultracinquantenni abbiano contratto l infezione prevalentemente per via eterosessuale rispetto alla fascia anni cui prevaleva la trasmissione tra msm la presentazione tardiva aids di questi soggetti suggerisce sia una scarsa percezione del rischio per hiv di questo target di popolazione sia la sottovalutazione dello stesso da parte degli operatori sanitari che considerano grandi adulti non pi sessualmente attivi l aumento dell aspettativa di vita ha indotto profondi cambiamenti negli stili di vita anche di questi soggetti necessario pertanto promuovere campagne di prevenzione mirate anche questa popolazione target e implementare la formazione degli operatori sanitari sulla base del modificato pattern epidemiologico dell infezione da hiv il cluster descritto conferma l innalzamento dell di prima infezione per varicella l adozione di misure igienico sanitarie rigorose nell

studi per standardizzare il sistema e trovare le condizioni pi appropriate per un efficace discriminazione la campagna vaccinale ha permesso di incrementare modo sostanziale il numero di vaccinazioni effettuate gravidanza dopo la campagna stato registrato un incremento significativo del numero di vaccinate contro pertosse ed influenza il successo dell intervento pu essere ascritto alla sensibilizzazione delle future mamme degli operatori e della popolazione generale nonch miglioramento dei percorsi di presa carico delle donne gravide il nostro studio delinea un profilo di sicurezza coerente con dati di preregistrativi e non sono stati rilevati segnali emergenti la sensibilit del sistema di sorveglianza ed il sistematico utilizzo dell algoritmo del causality assessment dovrebbero essere implementati tramite l attivazione di programmi di sorveglianza attiva dallo studio emerge come le cv siano state pi elevate per la prima coorte di introduzione del vaccino anti hpv nelle femmine rispetto ai maschi nonostante il ciclo completo fosse di dosi invece di si evidenzia la necessit di implementare campagne di informazione sull importanza del vaccino anti hpv entrambi sessi la maggiore adesione alla vaccinazione anti hpv sia per femmine che per maschi nell esperienza empolese dovuta ad una scelta organizzativa di chiamata attiva domicilio e di coinvolgimento dei pediatri di famiglia questo ha contribuito ad aumentare la compliance alla vaccinazione e pu essere un modello da proporre anche alle altre realt territoriali avvalendosi di software grado di auto generare gli inviti dati di copertura vaccinale ed immunitaria del campione studio hanno evidenziato tassi ben di sotto dei valori raccomandati dal pnpv sebbene un miglioramento si sia osservato grazie introduzione della valutazione dello stato immunitario anti rosolia fertile e della vaccinazione contro l epatite b nei soggetti nati dal poi nello specifico dati confermano la maggiore percezione negli os del rischio personale di contrarre le malattie vaccino prevenibili elevati livelli di immunizzazione contro l hbv e la bassa percezione del rischio di trasmettere le patologie vaccino prevenibili ai propri pazienti bassa copertura vaccinale contro influenza dtp mprv termine della stagione il programma integrato di informazione ed offerta attiva reparto ha dimostrato un buon livello di successo nell aoup mentre nella stagione precedente il numero di dosi somministrate nonostante l offerta attiva reparto aveva portato solo ad uno scarso aumento della copertura vaccinale totale nella ultima stagione risultati sono stati pi evidenti il fatto che pi della met delle dosi siano state somministrate reparto dimostra come gli operatori abbiano ampiamente gradito questo tipo di offerta resta comunque importante sottolineare che nonostante gli sforzi fatti il livello di copertura generale contro l influenza negli os rimane drammaticamente basso tutti pazienti durante il counselling vaccinale hanno riferito di sentirsi tranquillizzati dalla presenza dell ambulatorio vaccinale interno dell ospedale e di avere la sensazione che fosse un percorso continuit con quello intrapreso con il proprio specialista tra gli operatori sanitari vaccinati ha affermato di aver apprezzato la possibilit di vaccinarsi durante una pausa interno del turno di lavoro emerge quindi come la vaccinazione di fuori dei canonici servizi sia una pratica da incentivare anche fine di diffondere una cultura vaccinale negli operatori sanitari anche ambito ospedaliero un clima di rinforzo istituzionale che pu solo giovare sistema prevenzione vaccinazione anti meningococco b negli adolescenti un opportunit di salute costo efficace il modello dimostra che la vaccinazione anti meningococco b negli adolescenti pu ridurre l impatto clinico della malattia riducendo costi diretti e indiretti e di conseguenza determinare un benefico globale sulla collettivit questi primo dati evidenziano un progressivo aumento della percentuale di aderenza programma vaccinale delle donne gravide dimostrando il successo del nuovo assetto organizzativo oltre che dell attivit di corretta

prima per numero assoluto con oltre delle somministrazioni effettuate sul territorio dell intera usl l obbiettivo deve essere tuttavia quello di ampliare e strutturare meglio la collaborazione fra centri nascita e servizi vaccinali e l informazione alle gestanti fine di incrementare livelli di immunizzazione gravidanza nonostante un attitudine complessivamente favorevole alle vaccinazioni mmg esibivano incertezze conoscitive meritevoli di interventi appropriati tuttavia la mancanza di relazione fra stato di conoscenza e promozione delle vaccinazioni evidenzia il ruolo di fattori individuali pi complessi non completamente definiti dall health belief model proprio delle indagini kap nel dei casi stata effettuata co somministrazione tre donne hanno rifiutato l antinfluenzale due per timore di reazioni avverse e una per mancata percezione del rischio di malattia tra le pazienti vaccinate con l antinfluenzale due hanno riferito febbricola dolore nel sito di inoculo e nessuna reazione avversa delle pazienti vaccinate con dtpa hanno riferito dolore nel sito di inoculo e nessuna reazione avversa nessuna paziente si rivolta dal proprio medico seguito di reazioni avverse le donne gravidanza dovrebbero essere sempre accompagnate da un percorso di prevenzione tutte le fasi della gestazione l esperienza di vaccinazione site del policlinico di bari conferma che la sinergia tra diverse figure professionali igienista ginecologo pediatra ostetrica e la costruzione di percorsi strutturati possono contribuire empowerment della donna gravidanza la presenza di un ambulatorio ospedale l inserimento interno del percorso nascita del counselling e delle vaccinazioni e il contatto telefonico offerto alle donne vaccinate ha consentito di ottenere una buona adesione alle vaccinazioni raccomandate metodi medici medici di medicina generale e pediatri afferenti network coordinato dal ciri hanno monitorato una popolazione di circa assistiti suddivisa per classi la

degli accessi vaccinali da parte degli os l attivazione di ambulatori dedicati la vaccinazione ospedale ovvero interno della stessa sede lavorativa il lavoro sinergico con la figura del medico competente l utilizzo del dissenso informato alla vaccinazione hanno influito notevolmente sull adesione alle vaccinazioni raccomandate un limite del presente studio rappresentato dalla mancata conoscenza del numero di operatori suscettibili per malattia che non permette il calcolo delle coperture vaccinali dallo studio emerso che bambino entro l anno di vita risultano essere pi interessati dalle ospedalizzazioni per pertosse con tassi che si correlano negativamente con le coperture vaccinali ci deve spingere verso l attuazione di strategie ad hoc volta sia proteggere questo gruppo di popolazione estremamente sensibile infezione pertossica sia mantenere elevate le coperture vaccinali non solo per quel che riguarda le dosi obbligatorie anche le dosi booster raccomandate evitando la formazione di sacche suscettibili risultati dello studio mostrano una moderata del tivadj contro tutti virus con buone performance nei confronti dei ceppi di tipo e una moderata contro ceppi di tipo b nonostante il mismatch verificatosi tra il lignaggio di tipo b circolante e quello incluso nella composizione vaccinale ci probabilmente dovuto alla crossprotection tra diversi ceppi di tipo b indotta

trovando anche le occasioni opportune per tale offerta la ex asl di empoli confluita nella azienda usl toscana centro si propone di realizzare e gestire una rete integrata di servizi sanitari di prevenzione ed tale ambito si colloca il modello organizzativo per l allargamento dell offerta attiva della vaccinazione dtpa nel soggetto adulto e rischio che viene presentato questa sede l allargamento dell offerta vaccinale alle cs permette cittadino paziente di ottimizzare la logistica della vaccinazione e di avvalersi per questa del proprio medico curante la registrazione nel sispc permette di monitorare l andamento delle coperture e popolare l anagrafe vaccinale con soggetti adulti le analisi preliminari causa del numero ridotto di vaccinati permette di individuare alcuni aspetti relativi conoscenze informazioni sui quali fare lev per promuovere la vaccinazione antinfluenzale nel setting delle rsa nonostante le numerose raccomandazioni ottenere alti livelli di immunizzazione negli os resta una sfida fondamentale quindi implementare l informazione fine di promuovere l aggiornamento degli os futuro resta da valutare se il rifiuto della vaccinazione da parte dell os possa determinare possibili conseguenze sulla formulazione del giudizio di idoneit del lavoratore oggetto di costante dibattito dati mostrano un adesione pi alta alla vaccinazione da parte dei soggetti appartenenti campione post protocollo con una totale assenza nel gruppo pre protocollo della titolazione degli anticorpi specifici dopo vaccinazione il tempo trascorso tra la somministrazione dell ultima vaccinazione anti epatite b e il rititolo degli anticorpi anti hbs pi favorevole nei soggetti appartenenti campione del post protocollo evidenziando l importanza della presenza di un protocollo di sorveglianza sanitarium lo studio ha evidenziato l esclusiva circolazione di vi di tipo nella popolazione afferente aousa risultato sovrapponibile quello osservato tutta italia il test cromatografico ha dimostrato bassa sensibilit rispetto esame pcr che si conferma gold standard per la diagnosi di sari da vi lo studio dimostra che pazienti non vaccinati presentano una probabilit sensibilmente maggiore rispetto ai non vaccinati di risultare positivi alla ricerca di vi questo studio ha permesso di quantificare il ricorso alla terapia antibiotica precoce e prolungata mostrando questa fascia di pazienti particolarmente rischio un associazione tra essa e una diminuzione della mortalit globale sarebbe opportuno condurre ulteriori studi per meglio valutare questa associazione e pesare l importanza della precocit e del prolungamento della terapia antibiotica presi singolarmente lo studio quindi attraverso la sola analisi della documentazione sanitarium ha permesso di evidenziare il consumo di risorse nella casistica esame sottolineando come lo shock settico determini un consumo medio maggiore linea con la complessit del quadro clinico sono stati inoltre valutati l impatto della setticemia sul consumo di risorse la tipologia dei microrganismi isolati e l antibioticoterapia adottata tali risultati nostro avviso suggerirebbero la possibilit di revisione delle attuali regole di codifica dai risultati dello studio emersa una prevalenza di ica di circa il doppio rispetto alla medium europea l indagine mediante l utilizzo di una metodologia standardizzata ha permesso non solo di stimare la prevalenza puntuale di ica e l utilizzo di antibiotici anche di identificare reparti critici ad alto rischio per lo sviluppo di ica dove implementare misure di prevenzione e controllo delle infezioni e dove effettuare un monitoraggio continuo per valutare l efficacia di questi interventi l implementazione delle procedure di manutenzione e disinfezione dei dispositivi hcus grado di ridurre il rischio di aerosolizzazione di chimaera il nuovo protocollo di campionamento e controllo della rete idrica ha comportato una riduzione significativa della contaminazione da legionella negli edifici ad alto rischio del nostro ospedale la sorveglianza costante e continuum ha permesso di sviluppare un protocollo efficace sia per interventi ordinari sia straordinari grazie alla stretta collaborazione delle unit igiene ospedaliera e delle attivit tecniche introduzione l efficacia della preparazione preoperatoria della cute misura di prevenzione cruciale delle infezioni del sito chirurgico fase preoperatoria dipende sia dall antisettico utilizzato e sia dalla metodica di applicazione dell antisettico stesso l obiettivo del nostro studio stato quello di verificare la modalit e correttezza delle procedure di antisepsi del campo operatorio e di individuare gli errori pi frequentemente commessi dati confermano quanto riscontrato letteratura ovvero che la mancanza di una corretta codifica della metodologia esecutiva dell antisepsi del campo operatorio determina una disomogenea modalit operativa tra gli attori coinvolti nella procedura particolar modo si riscontrano mancanze tutti livelli fondamentali della procedura di antisepsi e difformit nei numeri di corretta esecuzione seconda della specialit si evince come risulti fondamentale la stesura di linee guida e protocolli condivisi per migliorare l appropriatezza di esecuzione dell atto e massimizzare la sua efficacia preventiva dai dati preliminari risulta che la scelta dell antibiotico nella profilassi peri operatoria da parte dei medici formazione non sempre appropriata pertanto si ravvisa la necessit di programmi formativi per implementare le conoscenze tema di antibiotico profilassi peri operatoria l approccio utilizzato aggiunta agli indicatori sintetici ha consentito di individuare principali ostacoli incontrati e le soluzioni adottate nel primo anno di attivit del pncar la sorveglianza di anni ha evidenziato la diffusione del clone epidemico tra gli isolati di kp cp tutti gli ospedali pugliesi e la circolazione dei cloni emergenti e recentemente definiti ad alto rischio e solo sporadicamente segnalati altre regioni italiane pertanto risulta fondamentale continuare l attivit di sorveglianza epidemiologico molecolare di kp cp fine di individuare tempestivamente l espansione di cloni epidemici con spiccate caratteristiche di virulenza e contenerne la diffusione la met dei ceppi stata tipizzata come variante monoallelica di il pi virulento e diffuso risultati hanno confermato l endemicit di bla kpc e l elevata prevalenza di bla tem bla shv nel contesto ospedaliero nazionale le varianti plasmidiche di mcr non sono state identificate accordo con dati italiani contrario linea con le evidenze disponibili la resistenza alla colistina ascrivibile perlopi mgrb e ad altre mutazioni che causerebbero la perdita di funzionalit della proteina ulteriori studi sono necessari per accertare la presenza del nuovo st e per meglio indagare la resistenza alla colistina nel ceppo che non ha mostrato mutazioni mgrb lo studio ha evidenziato che nel il consumo di antibiotici ambito comunitario molise linea con le stime europee disponibili per lo stesso anno dall european centre disease prevention control ddd range e leggermente pi basso rispetto alla medium nazionale ddd il monitoraggio del consumo di antibiotici sia ambito comunitario sia livello ospedaliero consente di migliorare l appropriatezza prescrittiva e di ridurre il rischio legato amr pertanto lo sviluppo di interventi coordinati per misurare e migliorarne il consumo rappresenta l elemento centrale dei programmi di antimicrobial stewardship tutti livelli che indirizzino verso la priorit di un uso responsabile soprattutto di antimicrobici ad ampio spettro ed ultima linea il pf risultato associato bmi e bambino con elevato bmi hanno presentato livelli di pf inferiori l utilizzo di test per la rilevazione del pf gi scolare potrebbe rivelarsi uno strumento utile negli studi di intervento incentrati sull attivit fisica e sulla riduzione di peso quanto facili da proporre e da somministrare interno di programmi di educazione motoria innovativi gi essere ambito scolastico introduzione l elaborazione del materiale comunicativo mc sanitario un processo dinamico che prevede il continuo rimaneggiamento di forma e contenuti mirato ottimizzazione della sua comprensione questa risulta dall interazione tra qualit dell informazione fattori personali e socio culturali comunicare un programma di screening alla popolazione comporta la difficile coniugazione tra l obbiettivo implicito di aumento mantenimento dell adesione e quello esplicito di empowerment specialmente per lo screening mammografico sm che presenta tra suoi limiti quello della sovradiagnosi alla luce della legge regionale ats citt metropolitana di milano ha realizzato del

integrato quali quantitativo con coinvolgimento della popolazione target ha consentito un equilibrio tra informazione trasparente e bilanciata e nudging sono emerse alcune barriere personali e socio culturali allo sm meritevoli di ulteriori approfondimenti introduzione l interprofessional education ipe e l interprofessional collaboration ipc stanno acquisendo sempre maggiore riconoscimento tra professionisti e le istituzioni che si occupano di organizzare servizi sanitari dall analisi della letteratura si evince che il lavoro team interprofessionali aiuti massimizzare e rafforzare le competenze dei singoli professionisti migliorare l efficienza e garantire la continuit delle cure soprattutto nella gestione di pazienti cronici l obiettivo di questo studio quello di valutare l impatto di interventi di ipe e ipc rispetto trattamento standard su pazienti affetti da cronicit l ipc una strategia innovativa per affrontare complessi bisogni di salute dei pazienti cronici c tuttavia una mancanza di evidenze sull impatto che l ipe pu avere sul trattamento delle cronicit sono quindi necessari ulteriori studi sia per valutare il ruolo dell ipe nel favorire la collaborazione interprofessionale che nel miglioramento dei risultati nei pazienti cronici lo studio di coorte teen sul benessere psicologico e sugli stili di vita di studenti di istituti scolastici secondari di secondo grado della provincia di brescia confronto tra primo e secondo anno di valutazione queste prime osservazioni suggeriscono un aumento seppure limitato della percentuale di studenti con comportamenti rischio e con malessere psicologico efficacia della campagna attiva di vaccinazione antinfluenzale adesione dei medici formazione specialistica iscritti alle scuole di specializzazione presso l universit degli studi di udine l offerta attiva di vaccinazione con le metodologie sopra descritte ha avuto un impatto positivo sul numero di mfs vaccinati sia totale sia per singola area tuttavia nonostante l incremento percentuale raggiunto si rimane ben lontani dall obiettivo minimo del identificato dall oms si evidenzia quindi la necessit di attuare ulteriori strategie di promozione fine di avvicinare ulteriormente tale target introduzione l organizzazione mondiale della sanit ha definito l obesit una malattia sociale che sta aumentando livello mondiale modo preoccupante sia popolazione adulta che pediatrica adolescenziale scopo dello studio di descrivere gli stili di vita e la distribuzione di sovrappeso obesit un campione di bambino e adolescenti della regione calabria risultati del presente lavoro evidenziano e confermano il ruolo fondamentale dell attivit fisica per il mantenimento del giusto peso corporeo inoltre ribadiscono la necessit di sorvegliare l imc nella popolazione pediatrica per identificare ed implementare interventi di provata efficacia talus da affrontare il fenomeno e prevenire precocemente il sovrappeso e l obesit dalla analisi dei dati raccolti possiamo affermare che l incremento dell indicatore infortuni giustifica pienamente l adozione della valutazione individuale risultati derivanti dai questionari hse suggeriscono che rapporti con colleghi e il ruolo sembrano essere gli stressor pi significativi necessario comunque ampliare l analisi agli altri indicatori per la valutazione preliminare ed espandere il campione sottoposto questionario per la valutazione approfondita fine di confermare dati emersi finora le risposte raccolte evidenziano una scarsa conoscenza di sdgs e agenda tranne per quella quota di studenti che ha partecipato ad attivit specifiche precedenza attualmente l acquisizione di competenze risulta delegata auto apprendimento alla formazione post laurea l attenzione questi temi nei programmi di formazione universitaria attraverso l implementazione di iniziative strutturate appare un elemento meritevole di considerazione la capacit di comunicare e di promuovere la salute la prospettiva del personale infermieristico risultati preliminari l infermiere spesso l operatore sanitario con cui avviene il primo ed il pi frequente contatto del cittadino con il servizio sanitario le competenze comunicative e relazionali sono pertanto determinanti l obiettivo dello studio stato verificare l opinione dei coordinatori infermieristici riguardo la percezione delle competenze comunicative negli staff infermieristici nei setting territoriali e ospedalieri risultati della nostra indagine seppur non definitivi rilevano che la metodologia per una comunicazione efficace una competenza considerata necessaria tutti setting assistenziali ancora carente il percorso formativo dovrebbe pertanto garantire competenze comuni tutti gli operatori sulla metodologia per interventi di promozione della salute basati sulle evidenze scientifiche valori soglia dell oms nella categorizzazione dell obesit risultano complessivamente pi restrittivi di quelli proposti dallo ioft di conseguenza parit di imc la percentuale dei bambino obesi risulta essere con criteri oms pi che doppia tali risultati sono linea con quelli riportati un altro studio di sorveglianza condotto italia criteri proposti dall oms si basano su dati raccolti usa nel e aggiornati con dati raccolti brasile ghana india norvegia oman e stati uniti e rielaborati poi con modelli statistici nel criteri proposti dallo ioft si basano su dati raccolti nel brasile gran bretagna hong kong paesi bassi singapore e stati uniti questi ultimi paesi presentano probabilmente un quadro epidemiologico pi simile attuale popolazione infantile italiana negli studi che vogliano valutare l efficacia degli interventi collettivi di promozione della salute nei bambino la raccolta del dato sulla circonferenza vita pu essere importante e informativo quanto quella dell imc e pertanto sempre raccomandabile la promozione di stili di vita sani rappresenta l arma pi valida per combattere le malattie croniche nonostante le indicazioni contenute nei codici e nei piani l attenzione degli operatori sanitari agli stili di vita risulta ancora insoddisfacente per questo auspicabile includere l educazione alla medicina dello stile di vita nella formazione di base post base e continuum dei sanitari aggiunta sarebbe utile pensare introduzione di una figura specifica adeguatamente formata che abbia il ruolo di professionista dello stile di vita previa analisi economica che valuti relativi costi ed benefici terminus di riduzione delle ospedalizzazioni disabilit e mortalit correlate alle malattie croniche nei anni trascorsi il consumo di frutta da parte dei bambino adolescenti nella merenda scuola si incrementato ad e nell area vasta passaggio dal nell necessita di costanti stimoli progetti come il mercoled della frutta sono dunque inseribili tra le buone pratiche per favorire corrette abitudini alimentari e accrescere la consapevolezza dell importanza di una sana alimentazione partire dai primo anni di vita violenza sui medici fattori associati con l aver subito violenza fisica negli ultimi mesi risultati di uno studio condotto nelle regioni del nord italia l aggressione sul luogo di lavoro pu essere considerato un rischio lavorativo pari di quelli biologico fisico chimico l esposizione alla violenza sul luogo di lavoro grado non solo di minare la salute del lavoratore anche di abbassare il livello del benessere organizzativo italia non sono sviluppate sufficienti strategie standardizzate per prevenire il fenomeno pertanto sono necessarie ulteriori ricerche per chiarire le conseguenze sulla salute breve e lungo termine sugli operatori sanitari necessario identificare e implementare validi strumenti preventivi agendo livello organizzativo e individuale fornendo strategie specifiche per affrontare episodi di violenza dalle analisi emerge da parte della popolazione una crescente frequenza di contatti per ottenere informazioni su logistica dei servizi e fare chiarezza sulle malattie infettive prevenibili con la vaccinazione ne sono esempio picchi di visualizzazioni concomitanza con casi di meningite occasione dei quali nell ottica dell outrage management il team di vaccinarsi ha prodotto e pubblicato dettagliati articoli grazie ai quali gli utenti hanno potuto informarsi e trovare risposte ai dubbi pi comuni la presenza nel web di riferimenti affidabili e valutabili campo di comunicazione vaccinale indispensabile per poter fornire informazioni corrette chiare e aggiornate utilizzando contempo un linguaggio semplice e di immediata comprensione risultati relativi alle patologie da carenza di iodio confermano l alta prevalenza di gozzo nel territorio oggetto indagine l efficacia della iodoprofilassi richiede ulteriore divulgazione affinch si raggiunga il target di adesione consumo di sale iodato successivamente sar monitorata l efficacia della campagna realizzata per verificare la soglia effettiva raggiunta la ricerca di nuove strategie di promozione di salute pu e deve essere sempre percorsa nel caso specifico il progetto prevede la realizzazione di una rete di albergatori che possano consorziarsi per favorire la consapevolezza della prevenzione fine di pianificare ideare e realizzare piani che promuovano la salute e perch ognuno abbia un ruolo attivo per il proprio e l altrui benessere sono stati scritti libretti della salute che forniscono alla popolazione mezzi semplici per comprendere ed attuare corretti stili di vita la divulgazione di talus libretti nell area geografica di pertinenza raggiunge l obiettivo di scelte salutari accrescere l autoconsapevolezza nei bambino e negli adulti e la loro fiducia nell efficacia dei comportamenti intrapresi per mantenere la propria salute nel tempo la valutazione finale degli esiti permetter ad ats di milano di rafforzare il proprio ruolo quale punto di riferimento sia operativo che di coordinamento organizzativo nella valutazione delle performance territoriali ambito sanitario e permetter di garantire percorsi di cura sempre pi efficienti e correlati ai bisogni dei cittadini gli interventi robotici urologici hanno rappresentato il del totale questo dato concorde con la letteratura che riconosce nella prostatectomia radicale robot assistita ad os l unica prestazione con un evidente vantaggio clinico per il paziente rispetto alla chirurgia laparoscopica risulta quindi necessario considerati gli elevati costi e le potenziali criticit organizzative ad esso correlate valutare l attivit di chirurgia effettuata mediante il robot da vinci nel contesto del principale presidio ospedaliero della regione piemonte per migliorare l efficienza e l accessibilit questa innovativa tecnologia questo lavoro ha messo evidenza come pazienti fast track specialistico hanno beneficiato positivamente del percorso mostrando tempo di attesa e di tempo complessivo di permanenza pronto soccorso inferiori di oltre il rispetto ai pazienti che non hanno usufruito dello stesso attualmente sono corso analisi per verificare se l inserimento dei percorsi fast track alleggerendo il carico del ps generale ha influito anche sui tempo di attesa e di gestione dei pazienti del pronto soccorso non coinvolti nel percorso fast track questo lavoro ha confermato il buon funzionamento dell obi secondo criteri di appropriatezza definiti dalle societ scientifiche evidenziando come pazienti ammessi obi abbiano avuto un numero inferiore di riaccessi entro le ore rispetto agli altri pazienti effetti della riorganizzazione del percorso del paziente con frattura del collo del femore anni nell azienda ospedaliera universitaria integrata di verona l intervento di natura organizzativa messo atto aoui ha permesso un marcato e duraturo miglioramento nella riduzione dell attesa per intervento nel paziente anziano con frattura di femore gli ospedali che presentano volumi di attivit minori non hanno ancora sviluppato completamente modelli organizzativi per intensit di cura che risultano invece sufficientemente implementati nei presidi volumi intermedi e ottimamente strutturati quelli ad attivit maggiore impatto clinico ed economico della gestione dei rialzi pressori gravidanza regime di pronto soccorso il possibile ruolo dei marcatori biochimici la gestione delle donne gravidanza con ipa complessa e pu portare visite e ricoveri non necessari con conseguente elevata spesa economica l utilizzo di test diagnostici basati su plgf come indicatore obiettivo della disfunzione placentare pu migliorare la pratica clinica e ridurre costi sanitari dall analisi emerge l importanza dell uva come supporto ai clinici nella codifica e nella formazione continuum e nell attivit di controllo interno e adempimento esercizio di controllo di ats con possibili ripercussioni nell assetto organizzativo alcune criticit su cui focalizzare l attenzione nell ottica di miglioramento appaiono la necessit di migliorare il sistema di reportistica rivolto ai clinici potenziare le risorse disponibili ed incentivare il processo di informatizzazione il crescente ricorso esternalizzazione dei servizi pone nuove problematiche sulla gestione di attivit fortemente impattanti su sicurezza e controllo del rischio correlato assistenza incluso quello infettivo risulta pertanto necessario da parte delle dmpo un deciso investimento culturale e organizzativo per assicurare un adeguato controllo del rischio e per garantire il rispetto dei determinanti di costo efficacia alla base delle scelte di ppp dall analisi dell offerta di chirurgia dell obesit sul territorio possibile affermare che sostanzialmente talus ricoveri soddisfano requisiti individuati dalla c ob inoltre sono state superate le criticit dello studio precedente sono stati infatti raccolti e analizzati dati pi precisi e completi dall analisi dei dati si evidenzia che nel tema della gestione del rischio gli item relativi management alla formazione e alle metodologie di gestione del rischio sono da implementare ulteriormente sul territorio possibile affermare che questo progetto di studio che continuer nei prossimi mesi su nuovi ambiti territoriali e con uno strumento pi appropriato contesto territoriale ha contribuito ad incrementare la conoscenza delle dinamiche dei servizi territoriali la presentazione dei dati relativi adesione alle raccomandazioni di cw il primo step nella comunicazione del progetto ai medici la variabilit tra zone distretto e tra presidi ospedalieri dimostra come la pratica clinica non uniformata livello regionale prospettando ampie possibilit di intervento la diffusione delle pratiche da evitare secondo cw solo un piccolo tassello dell appropriatezza che speriamo possa diffondersi il pi possibile livello globale lo studio volto creare un sistema di valutazione delle performance delle strutture sociosanitarie supporto delle attivit di controllo dell ats fornendo un quadro dei fattori di rischio maggiormente associati fenomeno considerato l approccio metodologico adottato estendibile anche alla valutazione di altre tipologie di strutture sanitarie e sociosanitarie considerando confondenti e gli indicatori pi idonei analisi del fenomeno disponibili nei debiti informativi dispositivi di sicurezza hanno dimostrato di essere significativamente efficaci nel prevenire le ferite da ago tagliente e la loro introduzione nella pratica clinica uno dei fattori che possono contribuire notevolmente alla riduzione degli incidenti percutanei questo metodo di prevenzione risultato facilmente applicabile alla collettivit capace di limitare la morbilit per affezioni respiratorie acute con conseguenze positive per la capacit produttiva della comunit il progetto attraverso il monitoraggio dello strumento aziendale elaborato sar valutato per la sua capacit di migliorare il percorso diagnostico preventivo e la presa carico del paziente integrando flussi informativi interno del sisp e con database regionali seremi istituto

saranno rilasciati due bollettini e un report finale passato l anno pilota la sorveglianza sar estesa tutte le regioni italiane introduzione necessario che viaggiatori si informino sui rischi per la loro salute legati alla situazione sanitarium del paese di destinazione e sulle appropriate misure di prevenzione per le malattie infettive farmacisti possono svolgere un ruolo chiave nel fornire informazioni sanitarie ai viaggiatori data la loro diffusione sul territorio ed il contatto diretto con la popolazione pertanto l obiettivo di questo studio valutare le conoscenze le attitudini ed comportamenti dei farmacisti italiani tema di prevenzione delle malattie infettive nei viaggiatori risultati preliminari dello studio indicano la necessit di programmare interventi di formazione fine di migliorare le conoscenze dei farmacisti tema di prevenzione delle malattie infettive nei viaggiatori affinch possano informare modo appropriato questi soggetti sui rischi per la loro salute presenti nei paesi di destinazione uso sperimentale di anolyte neutra presso il perrino di brindisi per la prevenzione e il controllo della legionellosi l analisi dei dati ha mostrato un abbattimento statisticamente significativo dopo la prima fase di shock con una carica batterica medium di ufc l rispetto alla concentrazione medium di ufc l di partenza dopo due anni di trattamento continuo valori medi di concentrazione batterica ufc l sono risultati prossimi quelli riscontrati post trattamento shock inoltre quest ultimo campionamento la percentuale di campioni positivi passata rispetto pre trattamento e post trattamento shock inoltre l azione di disinfezione con anolyte neutra si svolta senza limitare alcun modo le attivit sanitarie interno dell ospedale sebbene ci sia un generale accordo sull efficacia degli interventi educativi nel migliorare il benessere del caregiver l efficacia sui sintomi comportamentali e sull istituzionalizzazione delle persone con demenza eterogenea e dipende da alcune caratteristiche specifiche degli studi quali la durata la componente educativa e la modalit di erogazione l health literacy dei caregiver di anziani con deterioramento cognitivo risultati di un indagine condotta con due strumenti di misura nella misura del livello di hl dei caregiver strumenti diversi forniscono risultati alquanto differenti nello specifico il livello di hl misurato con il tohfla risulta tendenzialmente pi elevato rispetto quello ottenuto con nvs conclusione il nvs risulta maggiormente discriminante nell individuazione dei caregiver che non possiedono capacit sufficienti per comprendere e applicare informazioni utili ad assistere soggetti decadimento cognitivo gli insegnanti delle scuole del distretto mostrano generale una buona opinione circa la pratica vaccinale e un corretto atteggiamento nel riferirsi alle figure sanitarie per ottenere informazioni affidabili tale dato potrebbe beneficiare anche del positivo rapporto instaurato nel tempo con gli operatori sanitari del territorio come mostrato anche dalla buona adesione questionario proposto un quadro incoraggiante occorre tuttavia mantenere alta l attenzione e proseguire nell impegno da parte delle aziende sanitarie per migliorare la formazione e la fiducia degli insegnanti nei confronti della pratica vaccinale e generale delle iniziative di promozione della salute il questionario risultato uno strumento utile per conoscere le discordanze tra il servizio erogato e le aspettative dei degenti fine di poter garantire il miglioramento del servizio di ristorazione e della qualit percepita sono stati individuati ambiti di intervento con incontri calendarizzati tra coordinatori infermieristici delle unit operative direzione medica e servizio di ristorazione per riorganizzare e migliorare la definizione dei capitolati di appalto e della qualit del servizio di ristorazione ospedaliera pratiche dei farmacisti nell erogazione di antibiotici assenza di prescrizione medica primo risultati dai primo risultati emerge che il fenomeno sia ampiamente diffuso e non sempre il farmacista tenta approcci alternativi per evitare l uso deroga e disincentivare l autoprescrizione il farmacista che rappresenta il riferimento professionale del cittadino caso di malessere pu svolgere un ruolo attivo nel controllo del fenomeno dell antibiotico resistenza atteso che l impiego scorretto degli antibiotici assenza di indicazione e di prescrizione medica il principale driver del fenomeno incrementare la copertura dei programmi di screening oncologici attraverso l offerta attiva nelle farmacie una scelta vincente l esperienza del coordinamento screening dell asl roma le difficolt insite un percorso di screening quali l eterogeneit delle informazioni fornite agli utenti la disomogenea accessibilit dei poliambulatori sul territorio che ostacola l aderenza ai programmi la difficolt di informare la popolazione che pur rientrando nelle fasce target non si mai sottoposta un test di screening possono essere sicuramente migliorate grazie alla collaborazione con le farmacie essendo la copertura un indicatore diretto di efficacia delle azioni di reclutamento dei programmi di screening la nostra esperienza dimostra che tale collaborazione vantaggiosa per favorire la copertura ai programmi di screening oncologici con un incremento mesi anche di punti percentuale rispetto

percezione e prospettive nel territorio laziale la differente percezione tra fumatori e non un dato interessante quanto delinea una opposta visione della realt tra due gruppi rassicurante la volont di molti fumatori di smettere di fumare anche attraverso degli interventi di supporto forniti dai datori di lavoro molti studi infatti sottolineano come un corretto stile di vita possa essere stimolato anche nel luogo di lavoro e con il confronto con colleghi non fumatori risultati di questo studio possono essere usati come punto di partenza per indirizzare interventi per promuovere la cessazione

valutazione del ruolo dell attivazione vaccinale di un ambulatorio site nei luoghi di lavoro sulla copertura vaccinale degli operatori sanitari primo risultati dai primo risultati emerge che la presenza di un ambulatorio vaccinale interno della struttura ospedaliera rappresenta uno strumento efficace per facilitare il raggruppamento degli obiettivi di copertura vaccinale previsti per gli operatori sanitari le principali sfide del progetto sono state di natura organizzativa e culturale l introduzione di un nuovo modello di lavoro condiviso e patient centred con una riorganizzazione di spazi risorse e strumenti dedicati ha consentito di migliorare il processo diagnostico terapeutico anche considerando solo la quota di soggetti che vengono ricoverati il burden di malattia delle polmoniti appare elevato terminus di incidenza assorbimento di risorse sanitarie e mortalit disturbi mentali e qualit della vita una popolazione colpita dal sisma del il nostro studio evidenzia come

sintonia con linee guida che tengano debito conto la problematica del post emergenza e dei possibili effetti lungo termine sulla salute umana rappresentano le migliori soluzioni da adottare per la gestione di talus emergenze importante promuovere una vera cultura della vaccinazione partire dalla scuola fine di sviluppare una maggiore consapevolezza della cittadinanza sul potenziale delle vaccinazioni e contrastare quindi la diffusione nelle fasce pi fragili della popolazione di malattie facilmente prevenibili tramite il completamento dei cicli vaccinali e la creazione di una immunit di gregge attraverso la quale soggetti protetti fanno da scudo coloro che non possono proteggersi nostri risultati dimostrano che le campagne vaccinali basate su pi attivit comprendenti formazione promozione attiva e facile accesso alla vaccinazione rappresentano un approccio efficace per promuovere la vaccinazione antinfluenzale il facile accesso alla vaccinazione site sembra costituire un elemento chiave per superare alcune barriere alla vaccinazione da parte degli operatori l esperienza di formazione condivisa della arsp ha costituito uno strumento formativo per medici formazione specialistica grado di fornire elementi di pianificazione e valutazione delle best practice per la prevenzione e la promozione della salute valutazione di efficacia di un programma di gestione delle

introduzione della figura del disability manager quale responsabile dell intero programma nostri risultati mostrano una bassa copertura vaccinale anti hpv tra le giovani donne e riportano un elevato interesse verso l esecuzione della vaccinazione una maggiore informazione sul ruolo dell infezione hpv nell insorgenza di patologia neoplastica non solo livello cervicale potrebbe contribuire ad aumentare l adesione alla vaccinazione e ridurre il carico delle patologie hpv correlate nonostante l introduzione dell obbligo vaccinale e il conseguente aumento delle cv la regione toscana la sola tra le cinque analizzate che raggiunge per entrambe le vaccinazioni valori ottimali di cv anche interno delle stesse regioni analizzate si riscontrano delle significative differenze delle cv raggiunte nelle singole province evidenziando come la gestione dell offerta sia ancora disomogenea consideriamo questo dato legato diversi fattori che possono e devono essere corretti quali il ritardo della conferma dell obbligatoriet della vaccinazione le difficolt di organizzazione e gestione nell erogazione dell offerta da parte dei centri vaccinali l approvvigionamento degli strumenti necessari e l allora assenza dell anagrafe vaccinale nazionale operativa e completa l incidenza di complicanze post ercp nella regione veneto risulta linea con dati di letteratura collocandosi ai livelli pi contenuti di incidenza tale risultato riconducibile alla presenza di una rete con centri di riferimento per la patologia bilio pancreatica con professionisti grado di offrire prestazioni endoscopiche diverso livello di complessit tutta la regione la conduzione di una revisione sistematica sulla possibile associazione tra inquinamento atmosferico e sindrome metabolica argomento di sempre maggiore

del trapianto nella popolazione di studio la paura degli effetti collaterali del vaccino mpr risultata essere il determinante principale dell intenzione di vaccinare insieme alla percezione dell importanza della vaccinazione per proteggere dal morbillo e dalla rosolia la fonte di informazioni riveste un ruolo importante nel definire le idee sui vaccini per garantire il sostenimento delle coperture vaccinali dovrebbero essere promosse strategie di informazione e comunicazione per aumentare la fiducia nei vaccini agendo particolare sulla paura degli eventi avversi con un coinvolgimento diretto degli operatori sanitari pur nei limiti della metodologia adottata la ricerca ha consentito di comprendere gli indirizzi comunicativi interesse igienistico e guidare il nuovo gdl contribuendo nelle fasi istitutive iniziali focalizzare l attenzione su elementi comunicativi pratici con la finalit di tenere fede alla propria mission contribuire dare forma alla comunicazione per la salute

analisi dei dati delle coperture vaccinali le coperture hanno raggiunto per l esavalente livelli subottimali mentre per anti mpr e anti varicella sono ancora insufficienti gli indicatori h dimostrano una maggior diffidenza da parte degli operatori e dell utenza nei confronti dell anti mpr rispetto esavalente cui si associa una rilevante quota di mancata cosomministrazione con il vaccino anti varicella la diffusione del vaccino anti hpv richiede anche interventi di tipo culturale nella popolazione soprattutto per quella maschile le coperture anti meningococco c risentono del calo dell attenzione successivo outbreak toscano e sono condizionate modo maggiore delle altre dalle problematiche dei sistemi anagrafici la rilevazione dei dati di copertura e l analisi degli indicatori

fragilit che seppur sempre presenza di severit clinica mostra una forte componente sociale opportuno e doveroso introdurre la valutazione multidimensionale della fragilit nei setting di assistenza emergenziale lo studio mostra come l aver trascurato la solitudine e la povert delle reti di relazioni sociali ambito territoriale rischia di innescare un pericolo peggioramento delle condizioni generali e un conseguente rapido incremento dell uso dei servizi particolare quelli dell emergenza di converso una maggiore attenzione ai suddetti fattori relazionali potrebbe favorire una riduzione degli accessi e dei tempo di permanenza con conseguente abbattimento dei rischi per pazienti e della spesa sanitarium primo risultati dello studio evidenziano come il consumo di antibiotici nell anno precedente pi elevato rispetto alla medium europea inoltre risultano diffusi sebbene linea con altri studi italiani comportamenti che favoriscono l emergenza dell antibiotico resistenza come l interruzione arbitraria della terapia antibiotica e l automedicazione pertanto appare necessario implementare programmi informativi destinati alla popolazione con il coinvolgimento di tutti gli operatori sanitari la differenza dei costi dei percorsi pre ospedalieri ed ospedalieri nelle differenti aziende erogatrici che emerge dalla presente valutazione mette luce come sussistano degli ampi margini di efficientamento nell organizzazione del sistema tale modello rappresenta il presupposto e l obiettivo di una nuova visione di rendicontazione economica non pi basata sulla valorizzazione

vaccini bivalenti e trivalenti risulta sicuro anche con dosi ravvicinate il global trigger tool pur dimostrandosi efficace nel ridurre il rischio clinico pediatria non rappresenta la soluzione definitiva alle problematiche del governo della gestione del rischio clinico poich non privo di alcune limitazioni metodologiche tuttavia lo strumento si rivelato innovativo quanto capace di garantire un approccio utilizzo multidisciplinare e multi professionale nonch una gestione integrata del rischio il global trigger tool potrebbe quindi diventare uno strumento di trait union tra le evidenze scientifiche e la pratica assistenziale perch offre la disponibilit di utilizzo di indicatori specifici e facilmente misurabili sul livello di sicurezza del paziente pediatrico nonostante le coperture

una delle cause della bassa copertura vaccinale contro l infezione da papillomavirus umano hpv rappresentata infatti dall esitazione dei genitori pertanto sembrato interessante condurre un indagine per valutare l esitazione dei genitori nei confronti della vaccinazione anti hpv risultati preliminari dello studio indicano la necessit di programmare interventi educativi fine di migliorare le

degli studi di firenzela vaccinazione dell adulto costituisce uno dei principali obiettivi futuri per la sanit pubblica italiana ad oggi diverse barriere concettuali ed operative impediscono il raggiungimento di ragionevoli coperture vaccinali questo target di popolazione iniziative congiunte tra diverse tipologie di os con la governance degli igienisti potranno contribuire superare talus barriere specialmente se supportate da utili e semplici strumenti operativi lo strumento ha permesso di fornire una fotografia accurata delle principali criticit punti di forza inerenti la sicurezza

contrarre malattie infettive e di sviluppare complicanze gravi pertanto sembrato interessante condurre un indagine per valutare le conoscenze le attitudini ed comportamenti di questi soggetti tema di vaccinazioni risultati potrebbero fornire informazioni utili per implementare programmi di promozione vaccinale ed organizzare efficaci interventi di offerta attiva delle vaccinazioni raccomandate per questo gruppo rischio risultati indicano la necessit di programmare interventi educativi per migliorare le conoscenze dei soggetti con malattie croniche tema di vaccinazioni necessario inoltre che gli operatori sanitari indirizzino loro sforzi per incrementare le coperture questi soggetti atteso che il campione di questo studio ha mostrato un attitudine positiva vaccinarsi la riorganizzazione della gestione del programma di screening del ccr attraverso l istituzione di un unico coordinamento locale e la standardizzazione delle procedure dapprima eterogenee tra vari distretti ha avuto conseguenze

fornitori e produttori siano presenti ambiguit sul potere cicatrizzante e antisettico del prodotto il caso questione certamente evidenzia che basso livelli di health litteracy possano indurre scelte sbagliate anche presenza di circostanziate informazioni da parte di autorevoli professionisti sanitari suggerisce anche la necessit di approfondire le caratteristiche microbiologiche di prodotti erboristici e cosmetici base di argilla per porre maggiore enfasi alle controindicazioni e rafforzare messaggi di allarme per l uso su ferite aperte lo stato di infezione tubercolare latente risulta una condizione infrequente nella popolazione sanitarium italiana come confermato dal nostro studio ulteriori indagini multicentriche che adottino metodiche omogenee sarebbero utili fine di rivalutare le indicazioni per la classificazione delle strutture sanitarie risultati preliminari di questo studio hanno evidenziato un livello di conoscenze non sempre soddisfacente si richiama pertanto la

consapevoli gli operatori sanitari di domani alla tutela della salute individuale e collettiva attraverso il confronto tra pari avvenuto anche con il supporto dei social medium l adesione maggiore da parte di studenti dell ultimo triennio del corso di medicina ha confermato l esigenza degli stessi di approfondire le tematiche inerenti questa disciplina e incoraggia la ripetizione di eventi simili dalla mappatura dell esistente e dalle interviste agli operatori emerge che le informazioni necessarie per una buona gestione della prevenzione primaria e dell educazione terapeutica non sono ancora pienamente disponibili inoltre la figura del paziente dovrebbe essere integrata nel sistema di valutazione per migliorarne la compliance la quantit di dati disponibili elevata secondo gli intervistati la diffusione delle informazioni risulta ancora scarsa quest ottica appare fondamentale formare professionisti sanitari sui princ pi della valutazione ed integrarli nel sistema informativo attribuendo

universitario agostino gemelli irccs una misura ampiamente sostenibile la mortalit pi alta nelle femmine rispecchia il loro maggior rischio di ammalarsi la diminuzione della mortalit nei primo due periodi coerente con uno studio pubblicato sulla mortalit italia nel periodo per gli anni successivi non ci sono dati letteratura l incremento della mortalit dopo il potrebbe riflettere l incremento della prevalenza osservato italia e molti altri paesi potrebbe derivare dal crescente utilizzo di farmaci immunosoppressori sono state osservate notevoli differenze geografiche con la sardegna che rappresenta un area ad elevata mortalit e prevalenza di malattia le principali limitazioni di questo studio sono la bassa accuratezza dei certificati di morte e l impossibilit di risalire ai casi clinici per confermare la causa di decesso dati riportati permettono di confrontare la nostra realt locale con altre aree geografiche e di evidenziare azioni specifiche di miglioramento nel nostro contesto emerso che la resistenza agli antibiotici particolare per le enterobacteriaceae si mantiene superiore alla medium italiana ed europea si tratta di un risultato molto preoccupante atteso che nei batteri gram negativi gli antibiotici efficaci disponibili sono pi limitati nelle degenze di area critica il personale risulta essere maggiormente sensibile adozione di pratiche corrette di igiene delle mani rispetto ai colleghi delle aree medica e chirurgica non risulta essere altrettanto sensibile per quanto riguarda presenza di ornamenti unghie non conformi il coinvolgimento di studenti dei corsi di laurea di infermieristica nelle rilevazioni si rivelata un importante occasione di formazione l approccio del multidisciplinary team discussion ha incrementato la collaborazione tra le diverse figure professionali con una conseguente facilitazione nella individuazione delle criticit e messa atto delle strategie risolutive stata prevista una integrazione della piattaforma asso con la creazione di un sistema di monitoraggio e archiviazione nel tempo delle varie attivit svolte manutenzione pulizie campionamenti per ciascun locale e dei rispettivi parametri di controllo questo

relative alla salute delle comunit l inadeguato utilizzo delle evidenze documentato sanit per tutti gli stakeholder pazienti e caregiver professionisti manager e policy maker sia nei paesi industrializzati che quelli via di sviluppo studi condotti vari contesti dimostrano che evidenze scientifiche di elevata qualit non vengono adeguatamente trasferite nella pratica determinando sia sovra utilizzo di servizi e prestazioni sanitarie inefficaci inappropriati sia sotto utilizzo di quelli efficaci e appropriati pertanto essenziale ridurre il divario tra ricerca e pratica sebbene siano disponibili numerosi interventi di sanit pubblica basati sull evidenza pu risultare difficile implementarli e sostenerli di fuori di contesti controllati anche la riduzione del divario tra ricerca e pratica rappresenta quindi un campo di interesse della ricerca sanit pubblica tal senso l implementation science che si concentra sulla comprensione dei fattori e delle strategie che influenzano l adozione degli interventi basati sull evidenza contesti reali pu rappresentare uno strumento utile anche se ancora poco utilizzato nella ricerca sanit pubblica per contribuire alla realizzazione nella pratica degli interventi evidencebased allo stesso modo tuttavia non sono rari gli esempi di interventi di sanit pubblica implementati assenza di una solida base di evidenze titolo di esempio si pu ricordare l oms che nel ha raccomandato l osservazione diretta da parte di personale adeguatamente formato di pazienti affetti da tubercolosi per migliorarne l aderenza trattamento una revisione sistematica cochrane nel ha poi dimostrato che l osservazione diretta di talus pazienti non grado di migliorare l assunzione dei farmaci rispetto auto somministrazione analogamente negli stati uniti sono stati condotti studi su soggetti sottoposti screening per la diagnosi precoce del carcinoma prostatico che sappiamo non essere supportato da solide prove di efficacia questi sono alcuni esempi che enfatizzano l importanza di garantire una solida base di evidenze per gli interventi di sanit pubblica un ostacolo alla integrazione dei risultati rigorosi e pertinenti della ricerca nelle decisioni di politica sanitarium pu essere rappresentato dalla scarsa tempestivit nella produzione di evidenze nei tempo utili alla decisione politica christopher jm whitty scrive che gli accademici talvolta sottovalutano la velocit dei processi decisionali e sarebbe pi opportuno pubblicare articoli di buon livello prima che le decisioni di politica sanitarium vengano prese la

delle infezioni le infezioni correlate assistenza ica costituiscono una delle maggiori sfide per la sicurezza del paziente tutto il mondo e spesso il problema ulteriormente complesso causa dell amr l emergenza dell amr infatti un problema globale che pu essere controllato solo mediante un attiva collaborazione tra gli stakeholder livello nazionale e internazionale il controllo dell amr si basa su quattro pilastri principali la sorveglianza delle infezioni delle resistenze e del consumo di antimicrobici le strategie di prevenzione e controllo dell infezione e della trasmissione dell amr ipc infection prevention control la stewardship antimicrobica e la ricerca e sviluppo quattro pilastri sono necessari per definire il problema ricerca e sorveglianza e per risolverlo ipc e stewardship antimicrobica tra diversi fattori implicati nel determinismo dell amr riveste un particolare ruolo l utilizzo eccessivo e inappropriato di antimicrobici nell uomo e negli animali particolare quelli utilizzati per la produzione alimentare l oms e le istituzioni nazionali e internazionali interessate stanno lavorando questi settori con un approccio one health per attuare un global action plan per contrastare l amr aumentando la conoscenza e la consapevolezza riducendo le infezioni e incoraggiando ad un uso prudente degli antimicrobici le recenti stime europee confermano che tra tutte le infezioni sorvegliate dall european centre disease prevention control ecdc le ica rappresentano quelle con il pi elevato burden nella popolazione europea particolar modo italia rispetto agli altri paesi europei elevato il burden delle infezioni dovute e microrganismi resistenti agli antibiotici anche se si considera la sua popolazione numerosa e invecchiamento circa un terzo delle morti dovute

un impegno continuo tutti livelli locale nazionale e internazionale per ridurre questa importante minaccia per la sanit pubblica non vi dubbio come ogni processo di valutazione del rischio sanitario debba basarsi primo luogo sull identificazione della letteratura scientifica pertinente tal fine naturalmente necessario effettuare una ricerca bibliografica rigorosa completa ed infine illustrata modo trasparente questa prospettiva la metodologia adottata dai processi di valutazione del rischio sanitario si avvicina molto quella adottata per le rassegne sistematiche caratterizzandosi per una scelta il pi possibile estensiva delle parole chiave per identificare la letteratura di interesse e per una strategia di ricerca e selezione degli studi facilmente riproducibile da chiunque ci comporta l uso di archivi bibliografici quali pubmed e la nota banca dati da esso contenuta medline embase scopus e web science anche quest ultimi contenenti medline ed eventualmente google scholar realt pi motore di ricerca che archivio bibliografico senso proprio viene talora utilizzata per il risk assessment anche la letteratura grigia ritrovabile per mediante ricerche complesse e non facilmente riproducibili attraverso archivi quali conference proceedings citation indexes di wos eric psycinfo cinhal proquest dissertations theses global international guideline library e l url eu l appropriatezza dell uso di tale letteratura grigia tuttavia controversa trattandosi di materiale bibliografico talora di limitata qualit e non sottoposto valutazione tra pari dopo aver identificato gli articoli di interesse occorre valutarne la pertinenza mediante l esame del loro testo integrale ed infine compiere una valutazione della qualit metodologica critical appraisal risk bias assessment quest ultimo processo estremamente delicato ed influenza modo sostanziale l intero processo di valutazione del rischio esso prevede la valutazione delle principali distorsioni metodologiche degli studi quali errori nella stima espositiva presenza di confondimento distorsione di selezione e di classificazione degli esiti sanitari descrizione incompleta dei risultati e impropriet dell elaborazione statistica valutazioni di questo tipo vengono frequentemente effettuate mediante l uso di griglie precodificate quali il risk bias della cochrane collaboration l hat del national toxicologiy program statunitense l uso di talus griglie tuttavia non elimina del tutto la soggettivit intrinseca del processo valutativo con inevitabili conseguenze sul giudizio globale dell evidenza scientifica resa disponibile da talus studi e quindi sui risultati finali del risk assessment specie qualora ci si intenda basare essenzialmente sugli studi considerati di buona qualit questa prospettiva una valutazione troppo severa delle distorsioni comporta l eliminazione ingiustificata di studi potenzialmente interessanti sino ad azzerare alcuni casi l intera disponibilit di studi compromettendo il processo di risk assessment contrario un processo di valutazione delle distorsioni troppo blando pu portare inclusione nel processo valutativo di letteratura di validit incerta francamente inadeguata anche questo caso viziando le valutazioni finali l analisi dei dati complessivamente generati dalla letteratura scientifica sia di tipo epidemiologico che tossicologico rappresenta un passaggio cruciale per il risk assessment questo ambito due sono le metodologie epidemiologico biostatistiche il cui uso si sta progressivamente diffondendo nell ambito della sanit pubblica con effetti benefici anche sul processo di risk assessment primo luogo nel corso degli ultimi anni si assistito ad un incremento esponenziale dell uso di metodologie biostatistiche dose risposta nell ambito del processo di risk assessment e pi generale nella ricerca epidemiologica e nelle rassegne sistematiche tali metodologie consistono essenzialmente nella cosiddetta spline regression analysis di cui oggi divenuto sempre pi frequente l applicazione non solo agli studi originali anche alle metaanalisi mediante routine messe punto da statistici quali l italiano nicola orsini tali procedure il cui codice sorgente liberamente disponibile per pro grammi statistici quali r e stata permettono uno straordinario rafforzamento del processo di risk assessment quanto consentono di modellizzare con precisione relazioni complesse quali quelle caratterizzanti gli effetti sanitari dei fattori ambientali e nutrizionali tali relazioni infatti sono frequentemente non lineari caratterizzandosi per curve ad u j di tipologia pi complessa persino nei casi di sostanze cancerogene specie se non genotossiche e certamente nel caso di fattori nutrizionali la descrizione precisa la rappresentazione grafica di talus relazioni dose risposta non lineari permette pertanto di identificare le soglie espositive alle quali si verificano effetti carenziali e tossici associazione specifiche esposizioni ambientali e nutrizionali tali informazioni sono di grande rilevanza per il risk assessment quanto permettono di individuare standard quali il safe level l upper level e il lower level delle esposizioni di interesse processi di valutazione del rischio hanno infatti generalmente e arbitrariamente assunto l esistenza di relazioni lineari tra esposizioni ed effetti sanitari ignorando la complessit di talus relazioni specie nel caso di fattori aventi sia propriet nutrizionali che tossicologiche pertanto sulla base di talus erronee assunzioni di linearit sono state generalmente utilizzate nel risk assessment metodologie biostatistiche quali procedure di regressione logistica lineare persino semplici analisi di correlazione per quanto riguarda le meta analisi l assunzione aprioristica di relazioni lineari tra esposizioni e relativi effetti sanitari ha portato diffondersi dell uso dei forest plot cio della rappresentazione grafica del rischio relativo associato alla categoria espositiva pi elevata esaminata ciascun studio rispetto quella meno elevata con aggiunta il calcolo del rischio relativo cumulativo limiti di tale metodologia sono evidenti essa non infatti grado di modellizzare le relazioni dose risposta complesse e non lineari ed modo particolare quelle che possono caratterizzare livelli espositivi intermedi secondo luogo tale approccio caratterizzato dalla comparazione delle categorie espositive tratte dai diversi studi e generalmente assai diverse tra loro tale eterogeneit determina l impropriatezza delle comparazioni effettuate tra gli studi e dello stesso rischio relativo cumulativo come evidenziano altres le profonde differenze tra risultati generati dalle due metodologie alcuni specifici contesti di valutazione del rischio una seconda fondamentale problematica metodologica associata analisi dei dati ed interpretazione dei risultati legata uso del valore della cosiddetta funzione come indicatore della presenza di effetti causali generalmente attraverso la sua dicotomizzazione sulla base delle due soglie tradizionali pari e questo approccio consente l individuazione un singolo studio una meta analisi della cosiddetta significativit statistica dei risultati ottenuti cio dell erroneit della cosiddetta ipotesi nulla tale metodologia ha sfortunatamente pervaso l intera ricerca biomedica nonch altre discipline da quasi un secolo da quando cio nel lo statistico inglese ronald fisher ipotizz come un valore di inferiore consentisse di attribuire l esistenza della cosiddetta significativit alle differenze osservate tra singoli sottogruppi nell ambito di uno studio questo approccio ha esercitato gravi effetti sull analisi e l interpretazione dei risultati della ricerca scientifica assegnando modo erroneo tale valore di la capacit di validare escludere l effettiva esistenza di relazioni causali intere generazioni di professionisti e ricercatori specie ambito sanitario si sono co formate uso di tale criterio convenzionale nell interpretazione dei risultati delle analisi statistiche col rischio di commettere tal modo seri errori metodologici quali l attribuzione di un effettivo ruolo causale alle associazioni statisticamente significative e soprattutto l esclusione di tale nesso di causalit nel caso opposto l apprezzabile lavoro di metodologi quale l epidemiologo statunitense kenneth rothman e numerosi altri ricer catori e metodologi e pi recentemente dell intera associazione statistica degli stati uniti ha evidenziato l impropriatezza delle interpretazioni basate sulla significativit statistica e quindi su soglie prefissate del valore di recentemente un articolo di nature sottoscritto da diverse centinaia di ricercatori e prontamente ripreso dalla societ italina di igiene nel numero del aprile di igienisti line ha ribadito l importanza di abbandonare l uso e il concetto della significativit statistica favore dell analisi delle stime di effetto della loro instabilit statistica illustrata dagli intervalli di confidenza e dell analisi delle distorsioni metodologiche caratterizzanti singoli studi anche nelle procedure di risk assessment pertanto l uso della significativit statistica sta conoscendo una profonda crisi identit con progressiva diminuzione della sua utilizzazione e della sua validit metodologica come gi da tempo riconosciuto da enti quali l efsa efsa onlinelibrary wiley com doi epdf gestione delle differenze di opinione nel processo di valutazione del rischio processi di valutazione del rischio sono generalmente effettuati da gruppi di lavoro comprendenti diversi esperti nelle tematiche prese esame quali epidemiologia tossicologia e nutrizione tali esperti procedono individuazione della letteratura di interesse analisi dei suoi risultati eventualmente anche mediante la conduzione di meta analisi e la considerazione delle evidenze e plausibilit biologico tossicologiche accanto quelle epidemiologiche ed infine individuazione di standard espositivi quali ad esempio average requirement ar adequate intake ai tolerable upper intake level ul e reference intake range ri pu naturalmente accadere che nel processo di risk assessment membri di un singolo gruppo di lavoro manifestino differenze interpretative e valutative anche marcate sui reali livelli espositivi carenziali da eccesso associabili ad effetti nocivi per la salute umana e quindi sugli esiti del risk assessment esistono proposito modalit per la gestione e la composizione di talus conflitti opinione che prevedono tra l altro la formulazione corretta dei quesiti la formazione progressiva di un consenso tra gli esperti e la documentazione trasparente e accurata di tale processo e delle aree residue di incertezza tecniche di gestione e superamento delle differenze opinione di questo tipo sono denominate expert knowledge elicitation e sono sempre pi frequentemente adottate da agenzie quali l efsa tali metodologie di cui esistono diverse varianti mirano ad ottenere dagli esperti l affinamento delle proprie opinioni sulle soglie di rischio procedendo con sistematici aggiustamenti e riesami progressivo avvicinamento delle opinioni dei diversi esperti senza permettere nessuno di essi di prevaricare nel processo decisionale e contempo evitando di renderne irrilevante il contributo un interessante esempio dell uso e dell importanza di talus metodologie nel processo di valutazione del rischio stato recentemente offerto da efsa nel formulare la sua opinione sui livelli ottimali dell assunzione di sodio attraverso la dieta pubblicata nel la transizione epidemiologica e demografica atto pone tutti gli operatori di sanit pubblica l istanza di una profonda revi sione di strategie e metodi di lavoro nonch delle

rischio di malnutrizione e quando istituzionalizzati dal risultano francamente malnutriti e dal rischio di malnutrizione nonostante un apparente opposizione agli estremi difetto v eccesso sottopeso v sovrappeso tutte le forme di malnutrizione sono accomunate da comportamenti alimentari non appropriati e da bassa qualit dietetica solo minimum parte sono diretta responsabilit dei singoli cittadini consumatori l ambiente sociale rappresenta storicamente una fortissima determinante nell alimentazione dei popoli perch si lega inestrinsecabilmente uno dei valori fondamentali delle societ passate e odierne il potere e la sua gestione nell attuale assetto sociale infatti il significato del cibo solo marginalmente quello di sfamare sfamarsi siamo affamati di cibo anche pancia piena desideriamo mangiare non per nutrirci e adempiere alle funzioni principali della vita di tutti giorni ben assai pi spesso per semplice concupiscenza e ricerca di piacere il passaggio di significato dal cibo come sopravvivenza cibo come merce di scarso valore etico trova suoi antesignani molti fatti aneddoti e personaggi della storia antica e recente il controllo del cibo stata la prima causa di emarginazione sociale e ha condotto attuale prospettiva di massificazione della produzione secondo una logica di basso costo alto altissimo profitto termine del secondo conflitto mondiale per ragioni sostanzialmente economiche produzione di cibo come spinta propulsiva di lavoro e ricchezze nazionali minate dalla guerra quello che era per pochi diviene tanto per molti ovvero una espansione e diffusione universale degli spazi commerciali alimentari secondo logiche di non sempre garantita qualit offerta e basso ricavo sul singolo pezzo logica conseguenza di tale cambiamento di prospettiva che gli enormi profitti del mercato alimentare si generano solo prezzo di enormi vendite di derrate con una proiezione diretta ipersfruttamento di terra acqua e suolo e spreco di circa un terzo dell intera produzione generata si genus quindi un perfetto approccio loss loss denaro energia e forza lavoro per produrre cibo e altrettanto quasi spreco di risorse economiche umane e materiali per gettarlo perdono qua si tutti e vincono pochissimi quei pochissimi che non sono produttori consumatori molto semplicemente distributori di cibo ogni parte del mondo ovvero la grande distribuzione organizzata gdo effetto diretto e promanazione di un ambiente sociale fortemente trasformato e omogeneizzato dal punto di vista dell offerta livello universale quello che ian grievink gi descriveva nel ancor pi vero e attuale nel fronte di un esercito di produttori primari e di una moltitudine di consumatori il filo rosso del potere e della decisione finale su ci che la gente dovr mangiare mano pochi enormi distributori ora il problema sembra essere lo sviluppo demografico e gli attesi nove miliardi di persone che popoleranno il pianeta nel con un evidente rischio fame per una comunit mondiale co numerosa solo assai recentemente la paura della fame e il bisogno alimentare stato contenuto eliminato molte nazioni solo dopo il grandi eventi di massa rivoluzioni e sviluppo industriale hanno creato nuovi ceti sociali e una ricchezza e abbondanza diffusa quantomeno alle nuove professioni la cosiddetta nuova classe medium e qui cambium l ambiente psicologico dopo la trasformazione di quello sociale una parte rilevante della nuova societ civile la classe medium lentamente inesorabilmente soddisfatti bisogni basilari inizier pretendere scimmiottando le classi di potere una buona dose di beni anche alimentari di consumo col tempo e con una maggiore offerta di lavoro e l avvento di mezzi produttivi e di comunicazione anche il popolo minuto tenta di affrancarsi dal lavoro e dalla carenza di cibo dando una spinta alla crescita globale cerchi concentrici dunque cambiano parallelamente dilatandosi le regole non scritte dell alimentazione sistemi distributivi le occasioni e le modalit di consumo l impatto emotivo del cibo verso le persone le famiglie le collettivit pi meno allargate l ambiente sociale si trasforma linea con un diverso assetto urbano e suburbano templi della distribuzione e vendita di cibo necessitano e pretendono spazi distanti dalla comunit civile barba alla coesione sociale grandi ipermercati si collocano alla periferia degli aggregati urbani con viabilit dedicata grandi metrature spazi commerciali che si diversificano per massimizzare le dinamiche di acquisto anche ai generi extraalimentari cambia di conseguenza l ambiente psicologico del consumatore medio occorre l autovettura non esiste pi una rete sociale di rapporti di vicinato cui l acquisto basico era quotidiano scelto giorno per giorno e altrettanto conseguentemente facilmente pianificabile con ottimizzazione dell efficienza e spreco praticamente nullo si concentra la spesa un giorno settimanale generalmente di fretta con poca possibilit di prevedere consumi dell intero arco di sette giorni la tendenza iperacquisto ingenerata dall iperofferta e la totale solitudine del consumatore mezzo alla folla dell ipermercato meno di non incontrare un amico un familiare silenzio assoluto e nessun contatto con nessuno dall ingresso alla cassa bypassata ormai dai meccanismi automatici del pagamento fai da te il villaggio globale applicato cibo tutti uguali di fronte mercato l omogeneizzazione alimentare partorisce per anche suoi estremi l ambiente sociale una societ aperta anche ai contrasti nasce co l esigenza contrapposta di chi vuole salvare il localismo il km zero lo slowfood vegani vegetariani restauratori delle buone usanze di una volta che non sempre lo erano davvero e chi invece cerca di sviluppare meglio le opportunit della tecnologia e della scienza e le sue applicazioni alla materia alimentare le conseguenze di una dell altra scuola cozzano spesso con l aspetto pratico e la realt degli attori gioco comunque una volont pi meno buona pi meno giusta di agire sull ambiente economico ovvero ricavare profitto resta il dubbio amletico se esista un limite etico profitto soprattutto su commodity che non sono beni di lusso necessit imprescindibili per vivere ambiente sociale e ambiente psicologico alla fine non aiutano ad ottenere quello per cui un operatore di sanit pubblica dovrebbe lavorare una logica dietetica del buono del giusto e del pulito per tutti cittadini consumatori il cambiamento dell ambiente sociale si ripercuote infine sull abbandono delle campagne perch non pi adatte garantire la sopravvivenza attesa quella propria e pubblicizzata dalla societ dei consumi il cibo oramai modificato nel suo aspetto gusto sapore tossicit e storia vive un momento di squilibrio tra il necessario e il superfluo perdendo identit e proprio la sua caratteristica di necessario diventando merce e l altro paradosso di tale assetto civile che la societ dei consumi che ha voluto e creato un modello siffatto si interroga oggi sulla comunicazione sul social sulla necessit di fare green economy e sostenibilit ora ricchi pretendono il cibo dei poveri un esempio per tutti il farro dando cambio un cibo massificato basso costo con alto profitto alla fine il controllo del cibo continuum fare la sua parte nei giochi di potere e non pi per ragioni di sopravvivenza qualit della vita per un potere alimentare che si automantiene espandendosi tutte le latitudini e concentrandosi poche enormi catene societ per azioni dove il fine primario non far mangiare la comunit civile fare l interesse degli azionisti il cibo perfetto allora diventa una cosa altra e aliena rispetto buono giusto e pulito della tradizione la desiderabilit sociale unitamente ambiente modificato produce un orientamento delle scelte che riguarda aspetti fino pochi decenni sono assolutamente marginali gusto olfatto vista sensibilit del cavo orale se predominano sensi ed emozionalit il cibo perfetto richiede zucchero meglio se semplice grasso per sapore e sale per sapidit si ribalta negativo il concetto di salubrit alimentare e il cibo perfetto diventa diretta generazione di cronicit il diritto cibo uno scenario di questo tipo di fatto negato se infatti esso pu essere descritto e sostanziato come un diritto inclusivo che va oltre la semplice razione calorica e di nutrienti minimum si allarga comprendere tutti gli elementi nutrizionali di cui una persona necessita per vivere una vita attiva e salute l ambiente sociale lo nega quasi esplicitamente molti se un diritto umano e come tale interdipendente interrelato e indivisibile rispetto agli altri diritti umani salute istruzione vita acqua abitazione informazione e non negoziabile l ambiente psicologico ed economico fanno la stessa cosa sui singoli cittadini e sulle famiglie di consumatori il dibattito sulla sostenibilit dunque che dall evento milanese expo poi diventato una sorta di mantra di moda bocca molti liberi e meno liberi pensatori dovrebbe riconsiderare il framework culturale filosofico e strutturale che l uomo ha volutamente creato prima ancora di affrontare possibili soluzioni ai problemi generati da malnutrizione e conseguenti cronicit come uscire

altri fattori concorrono ad incrementarne il rischio esposizioni ambientali professionali particolato atmosferico metalli pesanti asbesto anche abitudini voluttuarie come il fumo costituiscono fattori aggiuntivi che possono incrementare il rischio di cancro polmonare fino ad oltre il si stima che italia oltre casi l anno di neoplasie polmonari ca dei casi totali siano attribuibili radon includendo essi soggetti fumatori nei quali l effetto deterministico moltiplicato la dose da radiazioni ionizzanti ai polmoni attribuita radon dovuta principalmente ai suoi figli prodotti di decadimento del rn che termina raggiungimento dell elemento stabile non radioattivo pb il radon un gas nobile quindi poco reattivo che ha una vita medium di circa giorni e se inalato non si attacca alle pareti del tratto bronchiale e viene espulso durante la fase di espirazione durata sec la probabilit che il radon decada secondo di circa trascurabile figli solo primo sono invece molto reattivi e hanno una vita

man mano che le sue dimensioni diminuiscono riescono con pi facilit superare le barriere del tratto respiratorio pm pm ecc la frazione libera dei figli unattached free pari che hanno le dimensioni dell atomo riesce superare tutte le barrire del tratto respiratorio e pu entrare circolo da quanto detto si comprende che la valutazione della dose assorbita da una persona che si trova un ambiente cui vi radon non dipende solo dalla sua concentrazione anche dalle condizioni fisiche dell aria dalle dimensioni del particolato presente dalla presenza di pareti dalle suppellettili dal numero delle persone presenti dal movimento che si crea nella stanza etc questo perch la dose principalmente dovuta ai figli che essendo reattivi aderiscono dappertutto impurit dell aria pareti della stanza

quasi raddoppiare il rischio dovuto esposizione radon rispetto quello finora accettato anche nel lgs e riportato nel vecchio icrp la tendenza sar dunque quella di rivedere ribasso il limite raccomandato e di disporre misurazioni e approcci pi rivolti alla condizione fisica dei figli nonostante gli effetti dannosi del radon fossero noti gi dal secolo xvi anche se maniera indiretta una valutazione del fenomeno nelle abitazioni italia stata effettuata negli anni dal gruppo di bochicchio il lgs ancora l unica norma nazionale di riferimento che identifica e classifica le situazioni lavorative nelle quali si pu verificare il rischio da radon art bi mentre livello regionale solo il lazio la puglia e la campania hanno emanato norme materia di protezione da radon ambiente confinato infine per quanto riguarda le concentrazioni di radon nell acqua destinata consumo umano il lgs del febbraio ha recepito la direttiva euratom del che fissa bq l il valore di parametro per il radon la

non bq questa direttiva doveva essere recepita entro il febbraio tutt oggi ancora aperto il tavolo di concertazione tra tutti gli enti interessati dopo la prima indagine nazionale molte regioni hanno condotto campagne di misurazione del radon sia livello regionale che sub regionale con l intento di effettuare una mappatura delle cosiddette radon prone area aree ad alto rischio di radon indoor senza tuttavia pervenire determinare le stesse dal confronto dei valori ottenuti nella prima indagine nazionale con quelli risultanti dalle successive campagne regionali provinciali si evince che le aree maggiormente interessate sono differenti ed particolare le provincie autonome di bolzano e trento e la regione friuli venezia giulia precedono il lazio e la lombardia altre indagini condotte livello regionale inseriscono anche la puglia tra le regioni con pi alta concentrazione di radon inoltre tutte le regioni e provincie autonome che hanno misurato le loro concentrazioni hanno fatto registrare un aumento dei valori medi di concentrazione fino ad oltre il con conseguente incremento della concentrazione medium nazionale non stato indagato il motivo di tale incremento alcune circostanze sono stati condotti studi pilota fine di indagare le cause di un eccesso di neoplasie polmonare quanto avvenuto per valutazione dei fattori di rischio per tumore polmonare nella popolazione residente provincia di lecce dove dati del registro tumori di lecce accreditato airtum e dell iss indagine sui cluster incidenza e mortalit individuano un eccesso di casi osservati

comuni con sir ab v per quanto riguarda il radon nell acqua la sua affinit misurata come coefficiente di ripartizione verso l acqua scarsa tende quindi desorbirsi piuttosto rapidamente inoltre ha un breve tempo di dimezzamento fisico giorni quanto gas inerte si pu muovere liberamente attraverso materiali porosi come il terreno frammenti di roccia quando pori sono saturi acqua come nel caso del terreno e delle rocce sotto il livello della falda freatica il radon si dissolve nell acqua e viene da essa trasportato l adsorbimento del radon acqua un fenomeno reversibile il suo facile desorbimento spiega perch la sua presenza maggiore nelle acque di falda rispetto quelle superficiali inoltre trattamenti e manipolazioni dell acqua effettuate per migliorarne la qualit ne abbattono le concentrazioni ci concorre il suo breve tempo di dimezzamento fisico la facilit di desorbimento fa che il radon disciolto nell acqua utilizzata per usi domestici possa contribuire aumento di

nelle acque potabili redatto nell ambito delle convenzioni tra ispra e arpa appa l enea inmri cri iss senza entrare nel merito della complessa materia della radioattivit nelle acque potabili si evidenzia che la direttiva europea prevede che controlli sul radon devono essere effettuati sulle acque di origine sotterranea e devono essere accompagnati dalla conoscenza delle caratteristiche idrogeologiche della radioattivit delle rocce e del tipo di pozzo inoltre controlli dovrebbero di norma essere effettuati nel punto cui le acque fuoriescono dai rubinetti normalmente utilizzati nel

inficia la rappresentativit del superamento del valore limite di bq l molto spesso rilevato nella provincia di lecce verr avviata una campagna di misurazioni dell acqua diversi pozzi con una metodica innovativa molto semplice realizzata dal laboratorio radongas di copertino le che detiene il relativo brevetto europeo il suddetto brevetto permette di misurare la concentrazione di radon inserendo una bottiglia acqua appena prelevata un dosimetro tracce come quello utilizzato per le misure aria dopo due giorni di esposizione dosimetro viene fatto recapitare laboratorio che provveder alla lettura la suddetta tecnica stata utilizzata anche per una campagna nazionale canada ref radiation dosimetry inoltre sempre provincia di lecce programmata un attivit di educazione alla salute nelle scuole secondarie di secondo grado cui gli studenti parteciperanno attivamente alle misurazioni del radon ed alla lettura dei risultati utilizzando metodiche come quella precedentemente descritta che pur essendo di semplice esecuzione garantiscono un risultato affidabile la regolamentazione sui requisiti qualitativi delle acque di riuso molto disomogenea alcuni paesi inesistente altri molto restrittiva italia il dm si basa sulla valutazione di ben parametri per alcuni dei quali limiti di accettabilit sono uguali quelli per le acque potabili questo impone trattamenti molto spinti e costosi riducendo di fatto le possibilit del riutilizzo se non nei grandi impianti livello europeo per la necessit di uniformare la normativa sono stati recentemente proposti limiti minimi di accettabilit per il riutilizzo dei reflui agricoltura che definiscono varie classi di qualit con relativi usi basate sui valori di pochi parametri e coli bod solidus sospesi totali e torbidit pi legionelle se esiste il pericolo di esposizione bioaerosol e uova di elminti per l irrigazione di pascoli colture per l alimentazione animale sono inoltre indicati trattamenti da adottare per le diverse classi ed livelli di efficacia richiesti per la classe corrispondente alle acque per l irrigazione di prodotti da consumare crudi il trattamento dovrebbe essere capace di ridurre e coli e cryptosporidium di log e colifagi di log questi requisiti minimi validi ogni caso fit debbono per essere integrati un quadro complessivo di analisi del rischio per promuovere il riuso preservando l ambiente la salute umana e la produttivit agricola secondo le caratteristiche specifiche di ogni contesto fit purpose tale analisi dovr comprendere sia rischi ambientali che quelli per salute umana ed animale tenendo conto dei pericoli identificati tutto il sistema di riuso degli ambienti delle popolazioni e degli individui esposti e della gravit delle relative conseguenze oltre alle normative esistenti per la sicurezza alimentare e dei lavoratori per la valutazione del rischio microbico pu essere utile la qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment che stima il rischio di infezione e malattia dalle concentrazioni di patogeni nelle matrici applicando le relazioni dose risposta ai dati di esposizione la valutazione del rischio chimico deve includere quando cooisciuti valori di predicted no effect level per l ambiente e di adi per l uomo oltre alla valutazione dell esposizione base ai risultati della valutazione del rischio potranno essere aggiunti ai requisiti minimi altri parametri particolare riguardanti alcuni contaminanti chimici metalli pesanti pesticidi sottoprodotti della disinfezione farmaci microrganismi antibiotico resistenti ed altri cecs dovranno poi essere stabilite misure preventive come trattamenti pi spinti per la riduzione dei contaminanti specifiche tecniche di irrigazione distanze di sicurezza ecc con adeguate procedure e misure di monitoraggio e controllo oltre piani di emergenza questo schema paragonabile ad un water safety plan con l aggiunta della componente ambientale accordo con l evoluzione normativa sulla salvaguardia dell ambiente e della salute umana che ha superato l uso dei solo limiti di accettabilit per una pi complessa ed esaustiva analisi del rischio tale approccio garantisce una maggiore efficacia preventiva e comprende anche la comunicazione del rischio che se adeguatamente condotta pu contribuire accettazione sociale del riuso delle acque reflue analysis national international reference context provided eurostat

patologie croniche ed il piano nazionale della cronicit pnc disegna la strategia da perseguire per il raggiungimento di tale obiettivo il nucleo di tale documento pu essere co sintetizzato contribuire miglioramento della qualit della vita dei soggetti della comunit delineando un sistema mirato prevenire e gestire la cronicit attraverso la promozione di interventi centrati sulla persona ed orientati alla piena responsabilizzazione di tutti gli attori dell assistenza esso tiene conto dei diversi modelli proposti dalla letteratura per la prevenzione e gestione della cronicit partire dalla piramide di kaiser osakidetza che differenzia la popolazione sottogruppi sulla base dello stadio di sviluppo della patologia cronica e dei conseguenti interventi che necessario attivare che viene riletta alla luce dell iccc innovative care chronic conditions framework che vi aggiunge una visione focalizzata sulle policy intese come processi e le linee di condotta che necessario mettere atto per ottenere il risultato desiderato concentrando l attenzione su quest ultimo modello non pu sfuggire ai professionisti di sanit pubblica che le policy cui si fa riferimento affondano le proprie radici nella cultura che negli ultimi due decenni stata prodotta dalla letteratura dell area della promozione della salute testa modello troviamo principi che forniscono struttura ai processi che vanno attivati rafforzare le alleanze sviluppare le risorse umane costruire integrazione garantire supporto alle leadership il cuore del modello centrato intorno idea che per ottenere migliori risultati di salute nel controllo delle malattie croniche sia necessario che tra blocchi della fondamentale triade su cui si fonda il macrosistema salute pazienti e familiari team dei servizi di assistenza e comunit si costruiscano partnership grado di avviare nel complesso del sistema quella nuova cultura che permetta tutti gli attori di possedere la motivazione l informazione e la preparazione necessari gestire la patologia cronica promuovere salute partire dai servizi sanitari vuole quindi dire accogliendo la sfida proposta dal pnc costruire buone pratiche che diano gambe talus policy perch queste non rimangano meri enunciati raccogliere e valutare esperienze che sembrano rispondere ai principi proposti dall iccc per tutti sottogruppi individuati dalla piramide di kaiser quindi lo sforzo cui tutti siamo chiamati contribuire linea con la sfida proposta si pongono il concetto di health literate e di health care organizzation di cui ci parler la collega lorini e l esperienza della ulss marca trevigiana di cui ci parler la dott ssa mazzetto lorini il pnc prevede che il soggetto sia esso malato rischio sia grado di comprendere come gestire la propria condizione e come muoversi tra vari nodi della rete questa capacit di comprensione non deve essere data per scontata co come quella degli operatori e del sistema sanitario di farsi comprendere per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi del piano risulta quanto mai calzante introdurre concetti di alfabetizzazione sanitarium health literacy hl e di organizzazioni sanitarie alfabetizzate health literate health care organization hlho la stessa organizzazione mondiale di sanit ha identificato la alfabetizzazione sanitarium che consiste nelle conoscenze nella motivazione e nelle competenze delle persone per accedere comprendere e mettere pratica le informazioni sulla salute come uno dei pilastri per la programmazione di azioni per la prevenzione delle malattie croniche la hl la risultante tra le abilit individuali e l interazione con servizi sanitari e altre istituzioni sociali non riguarda solo le persone anche integrata nelle strutture organizzative e nei sistemi sociali sorensen pertanto nei servizi sanitari centrati sulle persone e non soltanto sui pazienti professionisti della salute devono cambiare la loro mentalit focalizzandosi sulle abilit del sistema per venire incontro alla complessit degli individui con differente livello di alfabetizzazione sanitarium ci risulta particolarmente rilevante oggi e lo sar ancora di pi nel futuro vista della sempre maggiore evoluzione tecnologica scientifica e organizzativa sanit che genus complessit e della transizione demografica ed epidemiologica atto sistemi sanitari attuali generalmente complessi sono disegnati basandosi sull assunto che loro utilizzatori abbiano un livello adeguato di alfabetizzazione sanitarium assunto che si scontra con una popolazione sempre pi vecchia con disabilit fisiche e cognitive con bisogni di salute complessi con una quota rilevante di soggetti con lingua madre diversa dall italiano secondo la definizione di brach le organizzazioni sanitarie health literate sono user friendly accessibili e comprensibili da parte di utilizzatori con diverso livello di alfabetizzazione sanitarium con forte attenzione alle modalit comunicative e alla verifica della comprensione del messaggio da parte del ricevente un sistema sanitario health literate non solo comprensibile ai cittadini contribuisce ad aumentare il livello di alfabetizzazione sanitarium individuale favorendo la riduzione delle disuguaglianze l oms nell ambito dell european health information initiative ehii e linea con health ha definito l action network measuring population organizational health literacy pohl network la rete di qui fa parte anche l italia ministero della salute e istituto superiore di sanit mira indagare l alfabetizzazione sanitarium europa sia livello individuale che livello organizzativo come prerequisiti per realizzare policy e interventi efficaci mazzetto un esperienza coerente con il modello che ha proposto la promozione dell attivit fisica come supporto terapeutico e preventivo delle lombalgie acute delle riacutizzazioni della lombalgia cronica stata sperimentata due gruppi di operatori sanitari dipendenti dall ospedale di treviso azienda ulss marca trevigiana un primo gruppo di operatori con diagnosi di lombalgia selezionati dal medico competente aziendale veniva valutato dal fisiatra e successivamente avviato ad un training palestra guidato da un laureato scienze motorie che consisteva due sedute pratiche seguite dalla prescrizione di esercizio da autogestire proprio domicilio con il supporto di un manuale un secondo gruppo di operatori rischio di lombalgia per e mansioni che includevano la movimentazione di carichi veniva avviato ad un percorso di coaching breve per aumentare l attivit fisica ad entrambi gruppi veniva anche fornito un ampio ventaglio di indirizzi di strutture sportive partnership formalizzata con l azienda ulss distribuite nel territorio alle cui attivit potevano accedere con tariffa scontata la valutazione breve e medio termine quantitativa e qualitativa mostrava oltre gradimento dei percorsi un significativo incremento dell attivit fisica tutti sottogruppi di operatori reclutati particolare sia quelli precedentemente sedentari sia quelli insufficientemente attivi congiuntamente ad un incremento nei punteggi di autoefficacia la sintesi tra modello biomedico intervento educativo e training focalizzato sul paziente e modello ecologico intervento sul gruppo nel luogo di lavoro e la costruzione di opportunit ambientali nella comunit nelle patologie multifattoriali di cui la lombalgia un esempio sembra essere la strategia piu efficace per un aumento dell empowerment delle persone il convegno nazionale hph che si terr quest anno torino il giorno novembre vuole appunto essere una palestra pi che una vetrina cui gli operatori sanitari potranno presentare le loro esperienze discutendole anche con l ambizione di costruire un futuro non troppo lontano una comunit di pratiche il gruppo del piemonte si preparato nel corso dell ultimo anno questo appuntamento con una serie di incontri seminariali che hanno permesso di mettere comune con operatori sanitari ed associazioni dei pazienti principali elementi della riflessione che si voleva avviare e hanno dato loro l opportunit di presentare le esperienze atto avvio che sembravano rispondere ai principi enunciati dal pnc esordiamo dall assunto che la salute bene comune e per tutelarla e promuoverla dobbiamo rifarci modello socio ecologico che evidenzia come le scelte comportamentali di salute di ciascun individuo siano il risultato della continuum e complessa interazione tra fattori biologici cognitivi e ambientali ricordiamo infatti come la carta di ottawa sottoline la necessit di un cambio di paradigma per riorientare senso favorevole alla salute l intero contesto di vita assieme agli stili di vita individuali di qui una definizione di promozione della salute che esige l impiego della lente della complessit per comprendere le relazioni che sottendono le situazioni superando un interpretazione riduzionista della salute stessa questa cornice la promozione della salute ha come cardini sono l empowerment la giustizia sociale e la visione positiva della salute si punta co ad un empowerment che non si orienti esclusivamente singolo individuo sia collettivo rivolto alle persone che mettendosi insieme acquisiscono il controllo sulla propria vita e della propria salute creando comunit resilienti e ambienti favorevoli alle scelte salutari questa contesto dinamico e complesso che contraddistingue la promozione della salute il dipartimento di prevenzione pu ambire svolgere un ruolo cruciale quest ultimo istituito livello nazionale con il l vo riordino della disciplina materia sanitarium norma dell art della legge ottobre venne alla luce provincia di trento con la l provinciale questa realt il dipartimento di prevenzione dp l articolazione organizzativa dell azienda provinciale per servizi sanitari apss volta alla tutela della salute ed miglioramento della qualit della vita della popolazione mediante attivit di promozione della salute di prevenzione delle malattie infettive e cronico degenerative di promozione della sicurezza negli ambienti di vita e di lavoro compito del dp quello di individuare e rimuovere fattori di rischio che possono nuocere alla salute dei singoli e della collettivit con particolare attenzione alle fasce pi deboli e maggiormente esposte mediante l uso appropriato degli strumenti messi disposizione dall epidemiologia basandosi su una nuova cultura organizzativa il dp mira superare il tradizionale modello organizzativo basato sulla differenziazione compiti specifici interprofessionalit multidisciplinariet ed integrazione sono caratteristiche del dipartimento volta valorizzare la logica trasversale dell attivit di prevenzione tra uomo animale ambiente e natura processi di integrazione e l azione coordinata fra dipartimento di prevenzione assistenza primaria strutture ospedaliere ed altre istituzioni della vita civile sono volti rendere pi efficaci le attivit di prevenzione e di promozione della salute il mandato del dipartimento di prevenzione co il primo livello essenziale di assistenza lea dedicato alla prevenzione collettiva e sanit pubblica con una vision ampia e multidimensionale volta ad interfacciarsi con tutti gli interlocutori che diverso titolo sono partecipi dei processi che lo vedono protagonista nello specifico la promozione della salute trova il suo alveo nell area di intervento f sorveglianza e prevenzione delle malattie croniche inclusi la promozione di stili di vita sani ed programmi organizzati di screening sorveglianza di prevenzione nutrizionale il dp dell apss di trento si propone quale cabina di regia dell attivit di promozione della salute portata avanti livello provinciale nei setting scuola comunit ospedale e lavoro le azioni messe campo sono linea con documenti di programmazione quali il piano di prevenzione provinciale ppp e il piano salute provinciale che una prospettiva di life course prevede interventi volti guadagnare salute che si interfacciano e si intersecano una costruzione progettuale con il medesimo filo conduttore con il mondo della scuola progetti sono essere e divenire grazie ad una costruzione di coprogettazione di recente una partnership robusta del dp con l assessorato istruzione universit e cultura e con l assessorato alla salute e politiche sociali sta definendo un atto di indirizzo rinnovato per la scuola che promuove la salute con la comunit l impegno del dp si fa particolarmente interessante grazie innesto della tecnologia come elemento rafforzante l health literacy e quindi l empowerment di comunit il progetto trentino salute che vede protagonisti il dp l assessorato alla salute e la fondazione bruno kessler ha fieri una serie di progettualit volta sostenere e facilitare le scelte di salute oltre che la gestione della patologia investendo sull innovazione ecco l impiego di app

orientata ad una progettualit che coinvolga modo strutturato l intera provincia si mira una progettualit rivolta alla promozione della salute ambito ospedaliero hph messo sistema tale direzione la progettualit del counselling rivolto alle persone con diagnosi di tumore alla mammella e colon retto cui l apss con il dp e il sop servizio ospedaliero provinciale stanno lavorando ne un esempio evidente nella ricerca del miglioramento progressivo dei propri processi l apss di trento ha aderito di recente sistema di accreditamento volontario accreditation canada il dp team leader alcuni gruppi di lavoro impegnati ad evidenziare la promozione della salute tutti percorsi e tutti contesti uno di questi gruppi il benessere nella popolazione inedito e innovativo tale gruppo rappresenta lo

sanit pubblica senza precedenti reso ancor pi preoccupante per il fatto che essendo un fattore predittivo per il persistere dell obesit anche nell adulta strettamente correlata aumento di patologie cronico non trasmissibili diabete patologie cardiovascolari tumori malattie respiratorie tal senso l obesit corresponsabile dell insorgere di mcnt che nella regione europea dell oms provocano almeno dei morti il del carico di malattia e una spesa sanitarium pari miliardi di anno ne consegue un rilevante carico di costi medici diretti che nei paesi occidentali oscillano generalmente tra il e il delle spese sanitarie nazionali tra principali determinanti dell obesit oltre fattori genetici si annoverano gli stili di vita e comportamenti scorretti errate abitudini alimentari e sedentariet che si istaurano nell evolutiva proprio l obesit unitamente alimentazione scorretta e sedentariet rappresentano assieme fumo grandi fattori di rischio associati alle mcnt che l oms nell ambito del iii programma dell ue materia di salute suggerisce debbano essere le priorit dei piani di prevenzioni e dei percorsi di cura clinico nutrizionale dei diversi paesi italia il ministero della salute ha intrapreso differenti iniziative per contrastare l obesit e promuovere la sana alimentazione ed il movimento quali il programma guadagnare salute il piano nazionale della prevenzione tavoli nazionali di lavoro tavolo sicurezza nutrizionale tasin tavolo obesit particolare rilievo merita relativamente alla trattazione odierna l accordo stato regioni valutazione delle criticit nazionali ambito nutrizionale e strategie di intervento siglato il novembre il quale richiede che ogni regione venga attivato sperimentalmente almeno un ppdta per l obesit nello specifico la conferenza delle regioni e delle province nel recepimento dell accordo ha inserito tra le osservazioni che si ritiene opportuno differenziare quanto fare nella fascia infantile ed adolescenziale rispetto adulto si ritiene che nei minorenni specie nell infanzia sia pi appropriato un percorso che valorizzi il ruolo del territorio e dei pls conformit di talus indicazione il sian dell asp di catania ha avviato sperimentalmente nel luglio un percorso preventivo diagnostico terapeutico assistenziale ppdta per l obesit evolutiva considerato che ormai ampiamente dimostrata l importanza di agire livello del nucleo familiare per avviare un processo di sviluppo della coscienza critica e di empowerment che consenta tramite l acquisizione di corretti stili di vita la rimozione la riduzione dei fattori di rischio modificabili si scelto di individuando quale target l intero nucleo familiare che stato co attivamente coinvolto nel percorso inoltre considerato che innumerevoli dati di letteratura evidenziano come le fasce di popolazione disagiata siano pi frequentemente coinvolte dall emergenza obesit e dalle sue gravi complicanze sfruttando un finanziamento psn si reso accessibile utenza il percorso titolo gratuito con l unico obbligo di garantire la presenza non solo del minore anche dei genitori e caregiver infine proprio per implementare l empowerment si scelto un approccio pratico esperienziali che sembra garantire migliori risultati terminus di adozione di stili di vita salutari e durevoli nel tempo si inoltre curato modo particolare la formazione dell equipe del ppdta considerazione del fatto che la letteratura internazionale riporta la presenza molti operatori sanitari di forti atteggiamenti negativi e di stereotipi nei confronti delle persone con obesit letteratura vi sono prove considerevoli che talus atteggiamenti influenzano la percezione il giudizio il comportamento interpersonale e il processo decisionale della persona e possono causare stress ed evitamento delle cure sfiducia nei confronti dei medici e scarsa aderenza alla terapia dei pazienti con obesit il percorso sperimentale attivato nel ha consentito attraverso la costituzione di una rete integrata coordinata dal sian dell asp di catania la presa carico multidisciplinare dell intero nucleo familiare e la realizzazione contestuale sia di azioni prettamente clinico assistenziali che di promozione di sani stili di vita alimentazione e movimento mirati essenzialmente aumento della consapevolezza e empowerment del nucleo familiare bambino affetti da obesit sono stati inviati prioritariamente dai pediatri di libera scelta e dai medici di famiglia equipe clinica multidisciplinare dell asp composta da medici specialisti scienza dell alimentazione branca equipollente dietisti e psicologi il cui coordinamento scientifico stato affidato ad un medico specialista scienza dell alimentazione piccoli utenti ed loro genitori sono stati contestualmente avviati ai percorsi di supporto gruppi educativo comportamentali gruppo di cammino gruppo di cucina didattica etc realizzati dal sian insieme si lavorato fine di far riscoprire la dieta mediterranea dichiarata nel patrimonio immateriale dell umanit dall unesco quale modello di alimentazione sano e salutare per tutta la famiglia altres stata attivata una rete clinica alla quale ove necessario sono stati inviati soggetti affetti da diabete disturbi del comportamento alimentare altre patologie inerenti per lo pi la neuropsichiatria infantile tra punti di forza del percorso va citata oltre la componente esperienziale l utilizzo di strumenti di counselling piccolo gruppo che facilitano la motivazione cambiamento e l empowerment del singolo come vero artefice delle proprie scelte salutari tra le criticit indubbiamente l impegno temporale richiesto alle famiglie partecipanti percorso cosa che nell attuale contesto socio culturale non sempre stato facile ottenere tale contesto l italia secondo uno studio dell onu condotto nel dall unisdr centro per la riduzione del rischio dei disastri e dal centro di ricerca sulla epidemiologia dei disastri cred nella top dei paesi del mondo che hanno subito pi danni dal dovuti catastrofi naturali come terremoti maltempo temperature estreme siccit tsunami e cicloni accanto ai rischi legati agli aspetti geofisici ed ai mutamenti ambientali le nostre citt presentano altre problematiche che possono configurare situazioni di emergenza legate molteplici fattori di carattere economico sociale e demografico la crisi economica che ha creato fasce di popolazione con gravi difficolt di accesso ad un abitazione adeguata e sicura con conseguenti fenomeni di affollamento e insicurezza sociale baraccopoli abusivismo quartieri degradati ecc l instabilit internazionale causa dell incremento della popolazione immigrata cerca di lavoro e soluzioni abitative possibili campi profughi soluzioni emergenza inadeguate ecc l incremento della popolazione anziana che richiede diverse esigenze accessibilit spazi sufficienti per mobilit assistita l aumento dei soggetti fragili monoreddito separati vedovi anziani solo precari con difficolt sostenere le spese di una grande citt esiste ormai vasta letteratura scientifica sugli effetti sulla salute determinati dalle criticit legate ambiente costruito particolare la globalizzazione e l urbanizzazione associati invecchiamento della popolazione interagiscono con determinanti sociali culturali ed economici di salute scolarit abitazione lavoro nell esporre gli individui fattori di rischio comportamentali per la salute uso di tabacco errate abitudini alimentari insufficiente attivit fisica abuso di alcol ecc grado di determinare alterazioni metaboliche e biologiche che predispongono alle patologie croniche generale l ambiente urbano pu incidere sulla salute agendo su diversi livelli alterando gli stili di vita della popolazione seguito di cambiamenti sociali ed economici indotti dall urbanesimo e ampia offerta di cibi e bevande non salutari facile accesso droghe prostituzione negozi di scommesse ecc con conseguenti impatti sanitari negativi quali sovrappeso ed obesit isolamento sociale patologie mentali malattie infettive ecc esponendo la popolazione rischi legati ad un ambiente fisico alterato dall inquinamento e emissioni atmosfera domestiche e da traffico veicolare rumore scarsit di verde urbano e di percorsi pedonali eccesso di traffico veicolare etc con conseguenti impatti sanitari negativi quali patologie respiratorie e cardiovascolari sovrappeso ed obesit incidentalit stradale alterando sistemi di supporto vitale della biosfera per la rilevante impronta ecologica delle popolazioni urbane moderne e modificazioni climatiche con conseguenti impatti sanitari negativi dovuti stress termici da freddo e da caldo calamit naturali e variazioni negli eco sistemi pertanto gli interventi di ricostruzione post emergenze oltre ad essere orientati verso la correzione delle fragilit e l aumento della resilienza dell ambiente urbano devono prevedere scelte basate su un approccio salutogenico la resilienza non implica il ripristino ad uno stato iniziale il ripristino della funzionalit attraverso il mutamento e l adattamento ci pu essere attuato contribuendo alla riduzione dei rischi indotti dai disastri livello urbano alla preparazione alle emergenze alla valutazione e alla capacit di dare una risposta coordinata con altri enti di gestione alle emergenze livello nazionale regionale e locale tale ambito ha avuto particolare sviluppo negli ultimi decenni l urban health una disciplina interessata allo studio della salute delle popolazioni che vivono ambienti urbani ed alla comprensione dei suoi determinanti fine di migliorare lo stato di salute degli abitanti delle citt negli ultimi dieci anni l urban health diventato un argomento di particolare interesse per la sanit pubblica come dimostrato dalle oltre mille ricerche e documenti pubblicati partire dal di cui oltre il dopo il la pianificazione territoriale ed urbana grande e piccola scala pu essere considerata uno strumento chiave per tutelare e promuovere la salute individuale e collettiva secondo quanto proposto nella carta di erice le strategie dei governi locali del territorio ai fini della realizzazione di una citt salute dovrebbero orientarsi secondo le seguenti linee di indirizzo promuovere una pianificazione urbana orientata incentivare comportamenti sani sia con la riqualificazione di aree esistenti sia con la progettazione di nuovi insediamenti ad e progettando citt grado di promuovere il trasporto pubblico e la mobilit attiva anche attraverso la realizzazione di strade e piste ciclabili sicure e ben collegate prevedendo luoghi e sistemi di spazi pubblici di qualit che favoriscano la socializzazione la coesione e l attivit fisica considerando le specifiche esigenze delle fasce di popolazione pi vulnerabili migliorare le condizioni di vita nel contesto urbano il cambiamento nelle condizioni abitative il controllo dell inquinamento indoor e outdoor l accesso energia acqua e sistemi di depurazione idonei contribuiscono garantire elevati standard di salute ed ridurre il rischio di patologie infettive riemergenti e di patologie croniche molte di queste problematiche interessano principalmente gli insediamenti abitativi abusivi ed informali raramente dotati di servizi tale ambito si dovrebbe agire incentivando la rifunzionalizzazione di aree dismesse ed il recupero di edifici esistenti da destinare anche edilizia sociale e collocando interno di percorsi socio sanitari le categorie maggior rischio di marginalit costruire una citt accessibile ed inclusiva con particolare riferimento alla popolazione fragile livello globale anche italia la popolazione sta rapidamente invecchiando con l avanzare dell molte tra le persone pi anziane andranno incontro disabilit fisiche e sensoriali le azioni concrete dovrebbero essere indirizzate favorire la compresenza di luoghi di aggregazione per bambino ed anziani e potenziare le politiche volta eliminazione delle barriere architettoniche nel contesto di vita realizzare aree urbane resilienti rendere gli ambienti urbani resilienti ossia grado di aiutare la popolazione le organizzazioni e sistemi vulnerabili resistere ad eventi distruttivi sia vigilando sulle trasformazioni urbane e sull incremento di volumetrie aree esposte rischio sia individuando strutture sanitarie aree sicure e strutture e strategie di gestione del territorio per far fronte ad emergenze climatiche caldo e freddo estremi favorire lo sviluppo di nuove economie ed occupazione attraverso interventi di rigenerazione urbana negli ultimi anni gli interventi di recupero del territorio hanno assunto un ottica pi ampia che prevede un approccio multipartecipato per fornire alle citt non solo un aspetto nuovo e competitivo un rilancio dal punto di vista culturale economico e sociale orientato agli aspetti ambientali tale ambito si deve agire per diffondere l accessibilit alle informazioni e servizi attraverso la digitalizzazione della citt sostenere le iniziative imprenditoriali del territorio ed il partenariato pubblico privato favorire la flessibilit e la riconversione dei luoghi per lo sviluppo occupazionale contrastare le disuguaglianze sociali nelle nostre citt assistiamo ad una sproporzione nella distribuzione tra centro e periferia tra periferie storiche e consolidate e periferie di nuova costruzione tra quartieri pianificati partire da una visione sociale ed inclusiva di citt e quartieri abbandonati stessi azioni concrete e realizzabili che possono essere adottate comprendono rafforzamento delle reti sociali presenti nelle aree maggiormente vulnerabili rigenerazione di spazi disuso e abbandonati rendendoli di nuovo fruibili come luoghi condivisi di aggregazione aumentando co il senso di appartenenza dell individuo alla comunit e incrementando la resilienza della stessa attenzione verso le fasce pi vulnerabili della popolazione indagando caratteristiche e bisogni funzione di una programmazione di interventi sul contesto urbano volti migliorarne l utilizzo e quindi la vivibilit migliorare il livello di conoscenza dei diversi stakeholder sui fattori che influenzano la salute nelle citt l educazione ad uno sviluppo sostenibile e soprattutto ad una gestione del proprio ambiente di vita attenta alla tutela della salute rappresenta oggi un obiettivo strategico per il presente e per il futuro delle aree urbane le azioni devono essere volta ad aumentare la consapevolezza dei diversi portatori interesse sulla corretta manutenzione e gestione dell abitazione sulla scelta di materiali bassa emissione sul corretto utilizzo di attrezzature ed impianti ambiente indoor favorire la formazione di operatori grado di gestire gli aspetti sanitari delle emergenze e formare gli operatori per conoscere nuovi strumenti di progettazione del territorio e rigenerazione assicurare una governance urbana partecipata livello urbano una buona governance sanitarium pu far che le opportunit e vantaggi siano pi equamente distribuiti e che l accesso alle prestazioni sanitarie sia equo e facilitato si deve tener presente che molte cause di cattiva salute non ricadono sotto il controllo diretto del settore sanitario per la prevenzione delle quali si rende necessaria l attuazione di approcci multisettoriali diventa fondamentale quindi condividere le informazioni sulla pianificazione della citt per la salute e incoraggiare il dialogo e il confronto tra le diverse professionalit coinvolte introdurre strumenti prestazionali quali quantitativi grado di misurare la propensione della citt promuovere salute nei contesti urbani contemporanei policy maker e gli stakeholder coinvolti nelle fasi di progettazione urbana di tutela e di promozione della salute pubblica stanno orientando le risorse economiche e le domande di ricerca verse azioni di health evidence based urban planning tale ambito sono azioni concrete e fattibili la conduzione di indagini finalizzate alla determinazione della qualit urbana percepita dalla popolazione l articolazione di studi osservazionali volti identificare qualitativamente le condizioni del contesto urbano gli elementi di problematica e di potenzialit emergenti promuovere la condivisione della conoscenza e l accessibilit informazione di fondamentale importanza la volont di partecipazione da parte delle comunit specialmente quelle pi povere ai cittadini mancano gli strumenti per essere determinanti livello politico e per avere un ruolo nella progettazione tale ambito necessaria una maggiore interconnessione delle varie discipline coinvolte sia di formazione tecnica progettisti architetti ingegneri ed urbanisti che sanitarium medici igienisti e operatori del territorio la divulgazione delle informazioni derivanti dalla creazione di piattaforme informatiche dalla diffusione di dispositivi mobili lo sviluppo di sistemi informatici grado di relazionarsi singolo individuo informandolo sui fattori che hanno influenza sulle condizioni di salute facilitando il compito degli operatori di sanit pubblica il confronto con casi studio di riferimento seguito dalla determinazione di problematiche e potenzialit alla base dell individuazione di best practice esportabili altri contesti il legame fra le caratteristiche morfo tipologiche e funzionali dei contesti urbani e lo stato di salute pubblica apre uno scenario fortemente attuale sulla tematica dell urban health la quale assume un importanza crescente tanto pi elevato il fenomeno di inurbamento che caratterizza la societ contemporanea passare da un approccio tattico incentrato sulla reazione immediata evento uno strategico incentrato sulla gestione lungo termine migliorare la preparazione e la resilienza dei contesti urbani risposta alle catastrofi ambientali e alle calamit naturali per garantire una prima risposta efficace e attuabile ricostruire migliori pratiche materia di recupero ricostruzione e riattivazione sociale dei luoghi migliorare la resilienza delle infrastrutture sanitarie del patrimonio culturale dei luoghi di vita e di lavoro rimuovere rischi sanitari imminenti causati da cattive condizioni di vita e inaccessibilit ai servizi di base promuovere iniziative sociali volta ad innescare e ad accompagnare un vero processo di innovazione delle politiche convenzionali sensibilizzare responsabili politici alla creazione di una differenziazione tra elaborazione e attuazione dei piani e dei progetti di trasformazione urbana incoraggiare opportunit di formazione per progettisti volta ad acquisire le competenze per affrontare la tensione esistente tra la necessit di coinvolgere gli abitanti nei processi di ripensamento degli spazi e la necessit di ottenere soluzioni con qualit formale ultima analisi come evidenziato dal dr antoni plasencia direttore del barcelona institute global health e promotore del concept barcelona superblocks le citt contemporanee non sono progettate tenendo conto di rigorosi criteri di salute oggi abbiamo sia l obbligo che l opportunit di invertire questa situazione e applicare tutte le prove scientifiche disponibili per trasformare gli spazi urbani e creare citt che ci rendono fisicamente e mentalmente pi sani salute urbana e sostenibilit ambientale dovrebbero essere prese considerazione sin dalle prime fasi della progettazione urbana e architettonica tenuto conto come gi detto che pianificazione e progettazione possono e dovrebbero divenire forme di prevenzione primaria e di collaborazione nel promuovere la salute mettendo luce la necessit di un approccio olistico alla costruzione della citt e del patrimonio edilizio che la costituisce questo approccio di tipo bottom una delle sfide emergenti per tutte le citt contemporanee e per la sostenibilit dei relativi sistemi sanitari delle nazioni coinvolte l impatto dei disastri naturali tecnologici risulta potenzialmente maggiore sulle aree urbane dove la densit abitativa incrementa la gravit dei danni e delle ripercussioni socio economiche dovute interruzione dei servizi essenziali l ambiente costruito contraddistinto da caratteristiche protettive che possono rappresentare un elemento importante per ridurre il rischio di catastrofe ed incrementare la resilienza degli insediamenti umani contrario la corruzione di queste caratteristiche come la perdita di edifici strategici infrastruttura pu aumentare la vulnerabilit di una comunit particolare le citt italiane rappresentano un significativo esempio di organismo urbano capace di evolversi e adattarsi agli eventi sismici che hanno caratterizzato la storia del paese l unisdr definisce priorit condivise livello globale nel sendai framework disaster risk reduction e fra queste risulta di particolare importanza per la presente discussione l ultima la preparazione ai disastri per una risposta efficace e per realizzare pratiche di build back better ricostruire meglio nel recupero nella riabilitazione e nella ricostruzione il tema del ricostruire meglio si ripropone dopo ogni evento calamitoso italia come nel resto del mondo puntando sempre pi alto gli obiettivi prefissati come ribadito da latina nelle ricostruzioni del passato italia si sono sempre evidenziate due tendenze una eterodossa che formula l ipotesi della nuova ricostruzione aree diverse da quelle danneggiate dal sisma altre parole il terremoto come occasione di riscatto e sperimentazione tuttavia la tendenza che va pi accreditandosi sospinta anche dall onda emotiva post sisma quella dei cosiddetti ortodossi di chi perora la causa del dov era e com era occorre per evolvere il concetto del com era dov era nel pi condivisibile dov era meglio di come era prevedendo il confronto con standard qualitativi attuali ogni ricostruzione stata figlia del suo tempo se quindi nel belice dopo il terremoto del si opt per una rilocalizzazione dei centri colpiti forti del boom edilizio e del fermento architettonico direzionato alla nuova costruzione friuli invece prevalse la logica del com era dov era dopo il sisma del umbria marche dopo il sisma del si inizi ad affrontare il tema di una ricostruzione attenta agli aspetti della riduzione della vulnerabilit tanto scala edilizia che urbana abruzzo si torna invece ad affrontare il tema di una diversa collocazione delle comunit e della nuova costruzione pi sicura dopo il sisma del non si pu che ribadire il concetto del meglio di com era questo concetto deve oggigiorno confrontarsi necessariamente con gli obiettivi dello sviluppo sostenibile di cui rimarca l importanza di rendere le citt e gli insediamenti umani inclusivi sicure resilienti e sostenibili latina rimarca questo concetto sottolineando come la ricostruzione dovrebbe procedere seguendo il processo di rigenerazione urbana letteratura la rigenerazione urbana viene definita come una policy integrata e intersettoriale promossa da un soggetto pubblico partnership con soggetti privati finalizzata recupero complessivo duraturo e olistico di un area urbana degradata nelle sue componenti fisico ambientali economiche e sociali questi terminus il concetto di rigenerazione non andrebbe confuso con l azione sistematica di puntuale sostituzione edilizia consentita alcune recenti normative regionali sebbene ci permetta di migliorare la qualit energetica e la sicurezza sismica generale delle nostre citt per quanto concerne la situazione normativa italiana le uniche leggi regionali specifiche sulla rigenerazione sono state emanate dalle regioni puglia lazio e liguria di queste nella sola lr della puglia ritroviamo principi generali della rigenerazione co come definita letteratura la delle marche materia di riqualificazione urbana sostenibile seppur non riferendosi direttamente alla rigenerazione urbana contempla diversi contenuti di integrazione interdisciplinare mentre altre regioni lombardia veneto emilia romagna toscana sardegna la rigenerazione introdotta alcuni titoli specifici nella legge urbanistica regionale punto fondamentale del concetto di rigenerazione urbana la necessit che le amministrazioni locali e nazionali sviluppino un approccio alla pianificazione integrata e ai processi di partenariato per massimizzare l efficienza nell uso delle risorse economiche implementare la resilienza e la sostenibilit ridurre le disuguaglianze sociali e rischi derivanti da disastri e dai cambiamenti climatici tutti questi fattori sono contemplati anche nella definizione della comunit sane una comunit sana quella cui un gruppo eterogeneo di soggetti interessati collabora per utilizzare le proprie competenze e conoscenze locali per creare una comunit che sia socialmente e fisicamente favorevole alla salute la salute infatti ritenuta una pre condizione necessaria per uno sviluppo urbano sostenibile ed essenziale per raggiungere un economia forte e una societ vivace particolare nelle fasi di emergenza post sisma e recupero su lungo termine necessario integrare gli aspetti igienico sanitari nel processo decisionale di ricostruzione fine di mitigare gli effetti negativi delle catastrofi e sfruttare la specifica condizione come opportunit per migliorare la salute e il benessere della popolazione generale nelle ricostruzioni recenti la sanit pubblica ha focalizzato l attenzione su altre problematiche sanitarie e sorveglianza epidemiologica interventi vaccinali etc trascurando questa opportunit di rigenerazione del contesto urbano vi una notevole quantit di letteratura incentrata sull impatto delle caratteristiche del contesto urbano sulla salute sia fisica che mentale sul benessere e sulla coesione sociale la creazione di citt non solo sane anche salutogeniche richiede nuovi approcci alla pianificazione dando maggiore importanza alla salute pubblica e riconoscimento di una serie di obiettivi correlati favorire stili di vita sani supportare la coesione sociale implementare la qualit dello spazio pubblico rafforzare la sicurezza stradale e personale garantire livelli di rumore e qualit dell aria accettabili garantire condizioni abitative adeguate ridurre le emissioni che minacciano la stabilit climatica questo approccio sottolinea la connessione dinamica tra le caratteristiche morfologiche e funzionali del contesto urbano e la salute pubblica ed un argomento cruciale per la societ contemporanea fine di aumentare la resilienza dell ambiente urbano contro possibili disastri futuri le aree di intervento prioritarie dovrebbero specificamente affrontare alcuni requisiti essenziali di miglioramento della salute con particolare attenzione alle infrastrutture per l attivit fisica come percorsi pedonali piste ciclabili parchi e spazi ricreativi nonch progetti di quartieri destinazione mista di infrastrutture di trasporto e politiche di utilizzo del territorio che garantiscano l accessibilit alle attivit produttive commerciali e culturali ai servizi sociali e sanitari per la comunit se da un lato si rileva la necessit e la volont ambito accademico di far convergere le line di ricerca su ricostruzione rigenerazione e principi della citt salutogenica dall altro gli esempi di esperienze realizzate tale ottica risultano ancora pochi e carenti di uno pi degli aspetti citati non esplicitamente definiti sicuramente tale problematica appare legata alla recente diffusione di ricerca e applicazione della definizione tanto di rigenerazione urbana quanto di citt salutogenica tra le limitate esperienze occorre citare quella teorica su illica frazione del comune di accumoli colpito dal terremoto del quella elaborata per il distretto di zeytinburnu turchia seguito del sisma del marmara del e quella della ricostruzione emilia romagna post sisma nel caso studio di illica stato sviluppato un progetto di rigenerazione urbana dal corso nella facolt di ingegneria dell universit la sapienza definendo la struttura di piano come un quadro strategico organico e integrato che ha identificato due obiettivi generali la ricostruzione identitaria dei luoghi e della comunit e la promozione del sistema economico locale e cinque specifici ricostruzione del tessuto edilizio ricostruzione del tessuto sociale valorizzazione integrata del patrimonio culturale diffuso promozione del settore agrosilvo pastorale promozione del settore turistico ricettivo la prefigurazione di un sistema complesso di azioni strategiche per lo sviluppo sostenibile nel medio lungo periodo delle aree colpite dal sisma viene approfondito interno di un quadro progettuale che consente di affrontare anche questioni che sono pregresse evento sismico come ad esempio il progressivo spopolamento la scarsa attrattivit di quei luoghi e una dimensione sovracomunale il distretto zeytinburnu localizzato sul lato occidentale della provincia di istanbul stato selezionato tra casi pilota per il progetto di ricostruzione e rigenerazione nell ambito dell istanbul seismic risk mitigation emergency preparedness project ismep il progetto basato su tre fasi pianificazione e progettazione costruzione e gestione quest ultimo sono inclusi il controllo e la valutazione del processo di rigenerazione urbana e ricostruzione il caso ha richiesto l integrazione di operazioni di riqualificazione del patrimonio edilizio di ricostruzione post disastro e di misure di incremento delle capacit delle autorit coinvolte il progetto iniziato come tentativo locale di beneficiare del fondo meer della banca mondiale stato chiuso perch non ha soddisfatto requisiti sopra indicati ha avviato alcune ricerche collaborazione con le universit nazionali per lo sviluppo di queste capacit sul territorio preparazione ai prossimi eventi nel caso della ricostruzione emilia romagna dopo il sisma del accanto alle politiche di gestione incentrate su interventi edilizi quelle socioeconomiche per la ripresa delle attivit produttive e la predisposizione dei piani della ricostruzione un ulteriore strumento elaborato dalla regione il programma speciale area attuazione dei piani organici po deliberazione dell assemblea legislativa con questi po la regione intende promuovere una ricostruzione di qualit da integrare con iniziative ed interventi volti alla rigenerazione degli ambiti urbani e degli spazi pubblici e privati oltrech alla rivitalizzazione delle funzioni economiche sociali ed amministrative il po di mirandola si articola una serie di scelte programmatiche identificando aree di particolare interesse per la rigenerazione del centro storico assi vocazione socio culturale commerciale integrando azioni materiali e immateriali si rimarcano tra le azioni materiali quelle tema di delocalizzazioni cio la possibilit di acquistare ricostruire un altra zona della citt con un contributo pari quello dovuto per l edificio danneggiato tra le immateriali la possibilit di finanziamenti per la creazione di start attivit commerciali e culturali per rivitalizzare il tessuto urbano nel caso di reggiolo il po individua ambiti particolareggiati rimarcando l importanza di ambiti pedonali aree verdi e spazi pubblici di relazione fine di incentivare percorsi ciclabili percorsi pedonali e laddove necessari percorsi veicolari sebbene non vi sia un riferimento esplicito ad obiettivi della citt salutogenica questi elementi di attenzione del piano sono decisamente orientati quest ottica nell ambito dello sviluppo sostenibile questi strumenti devono coordinarsi con piani della ricostruzione dei relativi comuni pongono nuove visioni obiettivi e priorit per una ricostruzione che vada di l del mero com era dov era richiedendo ai progettisti e agli attori della ricostruzione una maggiore attenzione verso gli elementi cardine della rigenerazione urbana e della citt sana il pi grosso ostacolo una ricostruzione ottimale la mancanza di una guida e di un coordinamento tra le diverse iniziative nonch la carenza di capacit degli attori coinvolti da questi coordinamenti capaci dovranno risultare le priorit e possibili cambiamenti che potranno guidare la ricostruzione post disastro dall analisi dei casi studio emerge infine l importanza di avere un piano personalizzato e preliminare ai disastri naturali consentendo di superare la dicotomia tra l impulso ripristinare pi presto le infrastrutture per tornare alla normalit e quello di usare disastri naturali come occasioni per il miglioramento delle zone colpite caratteri differenti e molteplici distinguono l ampia casistica delle situazioni di emergenza e altrettante criticit si presentano nel momento cui l uomo cerca di porvi rimedio con risposte differenti per temporaneit efficacia ed impatto dell intervento sul territorio negli ultimi anni si sono registrati numerosi eventi che hanno determinato situazioni di emergenza livello sanitario epidemico ambientale e socio politico scala globale locale seppur dovuti da differenti cause l aspetto che accomuna questi diversi stati di emergenza la necessit di garantire strutture socio sanitarie e abitative che possano supportare le operazioni di primo soccorso tale contesto pertanto di fondamentale importanza la risposta delle strutture sanitarie esistenti e l allestimento di strutture socio sanitarie e abitative grado di assicurare un ricovero coloro che hanno dovuto abbandonare la propria abitazione tale tema risulta essere estremamente attuale e di fondamentale importanza interno del quadro sociale globale perch tale condizione implica necessariamente una diffusione capillare della conoscenza delle suddette tematiche modo tale da implementare e migliorare la risposta emergenza supervisionato ottimo per la classificazione e analisi di variabili precostituite ad e rilevazione di un nodulo polmonare da una radiografia del torace modelli di stima del rischio della terapia anticoagulante rilevazione dell aritmia nell elettrocardiogramma progettazione e sviluppo di clinico silico ecc non supervisionato utilizza set di dati di grandi dimensioni e identifica modelli di interazione tra le variabili queste tecniche possono scoprire associazioni precedentemente sconosciute generare nuove ipotesi e guidare ricercatori e risorse verso direzioni pi fruttuose spesso usato nell esplorazione dei dati e nella generazione di nuove ipotesi un sotto insieme del machine learning con grandi applicazioni campo di sanit pubblica ed epidemiologia il cosiddetto deep learning che imita il funzionamento del cervello umano utilizzando pi stratus di reti neuronali artificiali per generare previsioni automatiche dai set di dati utilizzati per addestramento e riconoscimento delle immagini e identificazione di un focolaio epidemico utilizzando le relazioni spazio temporali tra gli eventi la conservazione e la condivisione dei dati sanitari attraverso piattaforme digitali progettate per fornire professionisti e decisori informazioni su esiti di salute e costi generati per risolvere il problema di salute del singolo paziente sono fattori fondamentali per l applicazione di modelli organizzativo gestionali improntati alle strategie basate sul valore value based healthcare rispettare la privacy delle informazioni sensibili questo processo resta una grande sfida per tutti sistemi sanitari la blockchain letteralmente catena di blocchi una struttura dati condivisa e immutabile definita come un registro digitale pubblico e distribuito le cui voci sono raggruppate blocchi concatenati ordine cronologico e la cui integrit garantita dall uso della crittografia immutabile quanto ogni modifica di informazione che viene apportata lascia una traccia di registrazione distribuita perch tutti nodi della rete ricevono una copia continuo aggiornamento superando il rischio di perdita di informazione dovuta danneggiamento di un server le sue crescenti applicazioni economia e finanza e registro transazioni bitcoin ne consigliano l utilizzo anche altri settori della societ come la sanit ad esempio dove la blockchain potrebbe risolvere il problema dell interoperabilit consentendo organizzazioni sanitarie e professionisti di raccogliere informazioni su un paziente da pi sistemi di raccolta indipendenti compresi software diretta gestione del paziente smartphone alcuni wearable device ecc questo aggiunta modo trasparente sicuro ed efficiente quanto svincolato dalla necessit di certificazione di qualsivoglia autorit centrale quanto la disintermediazione non richiede operatori e funzioni dedicate dal momento che tutti partecipanti alla rete hanno accesso registro distribuito ci sembra particolarmente utile nelle attivit di prevenzione e promozione della salute nonch nella gestione dei pazienti che soffrono di malattie cronico degenerative quanto facilitano l erogazione di atti medico sanitari programmati connettendo direttamente il paziente cittadino ai servizi istituzioni e asl scuola ecc e mettendo accesso comune trasparente e certificato tutti dati e registro delle vaccinazioni aderenza e screening ecc questo modo sar possibile aumentare l interoperabilit senza compromettere la sicurezza garantendo migliori standard di cura e proteggendo contempo la privacy dei pazienti nonostante le grandi aspettative date dalla digitalizzazione resta inteso che gli aspetti pi umanistici e meno analitici della medicina di sanit pubblica saranno molto pi difficili da sostituire con la tecnologia l arte di prendersi cura tutte le sue componenti come la comunicazione l empatia il processo decisionale condiviso la leadership e il team building dovr trovare sin da os maggior spazio nel curriculum di medici e professionisti della salute soltanto attraverso questa sinergia potremo ottenere l obiettivo di umanizzare la medicina attraverso le nuove tecnologie seppur l effetto netto della digitalizzazione sanit pubblica sia difficile da prevedere soprattutto un contesto di incertezza politico programmatoria ed economica plausibile che il suo effetto sulla salute pubblica possa essere principalmente indiretto ad esempio se l intelligenza artificiale avr il potenziale per migliorare l efficienza e l efficacia dei processi attraverso un continuum della salute pubblica tra una gestione personalizzata del paziente e l ottica di popolazione particolare attenzione dovr rimanere rivolta ai determinanti sociali di salute difatti ci che da un lato produrr profondi vantaggi grazie un miglioramento della produttivit e delle prestazioni dei sistemi sanitari dall altro complice l ampia automazione dei lavori manuali qualora non correttamente governato potrebbe causare nel breve periodo disoccupazione nelle comunit basso reddito con aumento delle diseguaglianze ed effetti negativi sulla salute formazione e tecnologie per la literacy opportunit per la sostenibilit del sistema sanitario nazionale mediante programmi di prevenzione pre primaria volti ridurre il peso della malattia e su un altro versante il riposizionamento dei farmaci opportunit per il sistema sanitario nazionale rimanere sostenibile attraverso la prevenzione secondaria volto ridurre il peso del cancro seno pazienti non diagnosticati completato l iter istituzionale della predisposizione del piano e della definizione con le regioni della relativa intesa si aperta la fase di implementazione della stessa ed particolare del raggiungimento degli obiettivi previsti rispetto ai quali si deve considerare come preliminare l attivazione della previsto assetto di governance tale assetto di governance identificato capitolo del piano anche sulla base di quanto espresso riguardo dall intesa del sulle linee di indirizzo sulla genomica sanit pubblica e dalle raccomandazioni delle council conclusion personalized medicine patient del questo scenario il previsto gruppo di coordinamento interistituzionale si configura vertice di tale assetto di governance come strumento di promozione e centro di responsabilit dell attuazione dell intesa di cui oggetto esso composto dalle direzioni generali del ministero dall iss dall agenas dall aifa e da rappresentanti delle regioni per quanto riguarda le reazioni allergiche va sottolineato che l anafilassi un evento eccezionale dopo una vaccinazione il rischio di anafilassi varia da meno di dosi di vaccino somministrate la sua gravit funzione inversa del tempo di insorgenza con le reazioni pi gravi e potenzialmente letali assenza di un adeguato intervento di rianimazione cardio polmonare che insorgono pochi secondo dopo la somministrazione del vaccino sebbene l anafilassi sia per quanto sopra detto eccezionale la sorveglianza dopo una somministrazione di vaccino deve comunque essere condotta per almeno minuti per poter rispondere prontamente ai primo sintomi e prevenire co la progressione della sintomatologia fino allo shock anafilattico per tale motivo ogni ambulatorio vaccinale deve essere dotato di un kit minimo strumentale e farmacologico per l emergenza sempre portata di mano controllato periodicamente per le scadenze dei farmaci adrenalina da soluzione siringhe da ml siringhe per tubercolina aghi di varia lunghezza soluzione fisiologica fiale da ml siringhe da ml e da ml trimeton fl ml idrocortisone fl mg fl mg fl g attrezzature di base per la rianimazione cardio polmonare pallone ambu con mascherine di diverse dimensioni cannule oro faringee sfigmomanometro fonendoscopio ecc dispositivo per l erogazione di ossigeno altres necessario che le procedure di emergenza siano conosciute da tutto il personale che opera nel centro vaccinale il quale deve periodicamente effettuare le esercitazioni sull emergenza appare evidente che sebbene ogni ambulatorio vaccinale debba essere equipaggiato con attrezzature e farmaci specifici e dotato di personale addestrato per far fronte anafilassi quando questa non sia prevedibile ossia rientri nei range di rischio sopra descritti per tutte le vaccinazioni allorquando sia noto un incremento del rischio di anafilassi rispetto atteso invece obbligo ricorrere alla vaccinazione ambiente protetto per vaccinazione ambiente protetto si intende dunque l esecuzione della vaccinazione una struttura di tipo ospedaliero che sia attrezzata per le procedure rianimatorie tale pratica deve avvenire allorquando come possibile conseguenza di un vaccino somministrabile vi sia per il paziente la presunzione di un aumentato rischio di una reazione ige mediata nella fattispecie una razione anafilattica grave fino allo shock tale rischio non prevedibile priori assenza di rilievo anamnestici altres ipotizzabile conseguenza della conoscenza di uno stato allergico del soggetto per pregressa reazione anafilattica grave immediatamente conseguente alla somministrazione di un dato vaccino sia esso singolo che combinato pregressa reazione anafilattica grave immediatamente conseguente ad altra causa farmaci alimenti punture di insetto ecc pregressa reazione anafilattica grave immediatamente conseguente alla somministrazione di un componente presente nel vaccino candidato per la vaccinazione asma bronchiale persistente e grave del soggetto da vaccinare angioedema sintomi respiratori vomito ripetuto somministrazione di adrenalina altro trattamento medico di emergenza dopo aver assunto uova per quanto attiene la somministrazione di vaccini ottenuti da colture uova embrionate peraltro raccomandato procedere ad una vaccinazione ambiente protetto anche pazienti per quali pur non essendo nota una situazione allergica siano ipotizzabili aumentati rischi per la salute conseguenza del manifestarsi di reazioni allergiche come nel caso di neonati estremamente pretermine caso di bradicardia apnea e desaturazione dopo la prima dose neonati con malformazioni cardiache considerazione del fatto che la gran parte delle vaccinazioni vengono eseguite nell infanzia l ambiente protetto genere identificato e strutturato con apposite procedure organizzative nell ambito di strutture ospedaliere di neonatologia pediatria e dove esistenti di rianimazione pediatrica per contro data la rarit dell evento anafilassi post vaccinale adulta qualora ricorra la necessit per specifico rischio di anafilassi di effettuare vaccinazione dell adulto ambiente protetto laddove non esistano specifici protocolli di interfaccia fra dipartimenti di prevenzione e le aziende presidi ospedalieri si fa solitamente richiesta specifica ai servizi di rianimazione delle strutture ospedaliere si tratta di vaccinazioni elezione e pertanto opportuno programmare con debito anticipo la seduta vaccinale infatti dovranno essere coinvolti un medico vaccinatore un rianimatore e personale infermieristico dal punto di vista operativo il medico vaccinatore dell ambiente protetto ha il compito di raccogliere e verificare preliminarmente dati anamnestici del potenziale evento avverso informare adeguatamente familiari del bambino sulla procedura di vaccinazione e sulla possibile comparsa di reazioni avverse anche di grave entit richiedere la firma del consenso informato alla vaccinazione ambiente protetto eseguire una valutazione clinica globale del paziente controllare farmaci dell emergenza e tenere disposizione sempre una fiala di adrenalina da diluire se necessario ml di sol fisiologica e due fiale di atropina da mg totale mg da diluire se necessario siringa da ml con sol fisiologica preparare il vaccino ed eseguire la vaccinazion monitorare continuativamente il paziente per minuti subito dopo la vaccinazione effettuare successive rivalutazioni del paziente ogni minuti per una durata complessiva di minuti volta eseguire valutazione clinica globale conclusiva prima della dimissione del paziente rilasciare la certificazione di avvenuta vaccinazione da presentare distretto di competenza per la registrazione il medico vaccinatore deve essere obbligatoriamente supportato da personale infermieristico che cura la tenuta dei farmaci e delle apparecchiature predispone un accesso venoso per l eventuale somministrazione di farmaci ed infusione di liquidi e monitora parametri vitali del paziente f c e saturazione prima della vaccinazione assiste il medico durante la vaccinazione e rivaluta il paziente assieme medico dopo la vaccinazione e ne monitora parametri vitali il medico rianimatore interviene invece solo caso di necessit qualora si dovessero presentare reazioni avverse di lieve entit il medico vaccinatore decider sull opportunit di prolungare l osservazione con un ricovero osservazione temporanea nel caso invece dovessero presentarsi reazioni pi gravi con compromissione di uno dei parametri vitali f c il paziente dovr essere gestito e adeguatamente trattato una stanza delle emergenze dal medico vaccinatore con l ausilio del medico anestesista rianimatore preventivamente allertato la dimissione deve prevedere l adeguata comunicazione paziente ai suoi tutori circa la possibilit di eventuali reazioni tardive descrivendone le caratteristiche e raccomandando caso di comparsa un immediato controllo pronto soccorso presso il medico curante peraltro il poter disporre di strutture ospedaliere per l esecuzione delle vaccinazioni ambiente protetto rappresenta un opportunit per ampliare l offerta vaccinale non solo pazienti affetti da particolari patologie che necessitano di conoscenze specialistiche emofilici immunodepressi malattie autoimmuni reumatiche metaboliche cardiache respiratorie renali di altri organi apparati rappresenta anche l opportunit per la somministrazione di vaccini label pazienti particolari e pi generale un occasione per ampliare l offerta vaccinale categorie difficili da raggiungere sul territorio che trovano nell ospedale un necessario punto di riferimento l ospedale che vaccina rappresenta pertanto non solo una necessaria integrazione delle attivit di prevenzione del territorio per quanto attiene alle vaccinazioni presenza del rischio di una anafilassi anche una importante opportunit di integrazione con servizi vaccinali del territorio ed ampliare co secondo quanto previsto dagli obiettivi dei diversi piani di prevenzione succedutisi l offerta vaccinale con il pieno rispetto delle buone pratiche vaccinali la comunicazione ha un ruolo essenziale ogni azione che mira migliorare e promuovere la salute nuovi modelli di comunicazione riconoscono che il processo di comunicazione comporta un interazione pi vie tra il mittente e il destinatario dei messaggi anche nell ambito dell igiene degli alimenti e della nutrizione la comunicazione infatti un processo transazionale e un contesto sanitario una parte importante del lavoro di promozione della salute anche per il raggiungimento di individui e popolazioni sane e contribuisce alla riduzione delle disuguaglianze la comunicazione sulla salute intesa come un fattore abilitante cambiamento dei livelli individuali e sociali per raggiungere obiettivi di sviluppo stabiliti compresa la salute suresh dal punto di vista formale la transazione di comunicazione consiste nel condividere informazioni utilizzando un insieme di regole comuni northouse e northouse gli sviluppi pi recenti della comunicazione nell ambito della promozione e tutela della salute riflettono l idea evoluzione che il processo di comunicazione nell ambito dell igiene degli alimenti e della nutrizione multidirezionale poich la popolazione generale cerca attivamente informazioni dai formati immediati e accessibili loro disposizione ad esempio da internet ci ha creato un modello di comunicazione che non pi un modello di comunicazione top guidato da esperti una forma di comunicazione orizzontale non gerarchica anche thackeray e neiger concordano con questa idea e suggeriscono un modello di comunicazione che enfatizzi questo approccio dal basso verso l alto e orizzontale questo modello presuppone che la comunicazione possa essere generata dagli esperti sia dall alto verso il basso che anche dal basso verso l alto e quindi generata dall utente e dalla condivisione laterale orizzontale ci suggerisce che un efficace comunicazione sulla salute debba comportare una transazione di collaborazione attiva tra il mittente e il destinatario kreps e neuhauser la natura multidimensionale e dinamica della comunicazione significa che le transazioni contengono altri aspetti che influenzano la comunicazione kreps ad esempio propone che l aggiunta di salute alla definizione del termine comunicazione come risorsa e ci consente di utilizzare messaggi nell ambito dell igiene degli alimenti e della nutrizione ad esempio nella prevenzione nutrizionale co come nella sicurezza e tutela alimentare questa ampia definizione incorpora il fatto che la comunicazione igiene degli alimenti e della nutrizione pu avvenire molti livelli di qui la necessit di una comunicazione istituzionale certificata igiene degli alimenti e della nutrizione una corretta alimentazione e quindi una adeguata nutrizione permette individuo di svilupparsi modo corretto crescere resistere alle malattie e superarle riuscendo svolgere le sue attivit quotidiane si parla quindi di sicurezza nutrizionale food secuity come viene definita nella letteratura internazionale riferendosi quella condizione per cui tutte le persone allo stesso tempo hanno accesso fisico sociale ed economico quantit sufficienti di cibo sicuro e grado di soddisfare le necessit nutrizionali secondo propri fabbisogni dietetici e le proprie preferenze pur riconoscendo alla sicurezza nutrizionale un importanza fondamentale per la salute degli individui ancora oggi denutrizione e iperalimentazione costituiscono entrambe le principali cause di malnutrizione particolare l obesit e il sovrappeso infantile costituiscono un serio problema di sanit pubblica sia nel mondo occidentale che nei paesi via di sviluppo poich oltre ripercuotersi direttamente sulla salute del bambino tendono persistere anche adulta nonostante numerosi sforzi messi atto negli ultimi anni la prevalenza dell obesit nei bambino drasticamente aumentata secondo dati dell organizzazione mondiale della sanit oms circa il dei bambino europei risulta essere sovrappeso e circa il obeso italia la percentuale di bambino sovrappeso obesi del di cui il risulta essere obeso e il di questi ultimi presenta una condizione di obesit grave questi risultati sono ancora pi preoccupanti se letti alla luce dei dati del sistema di sorveglianza passi passi secondo cui solo persona su della popolazione italiana consuma quotidianamente le porzioni raccomandate di frutta e verdura mentre secondo dati del sistema di sorveglianza okkio alla salute il dei bambino non consuma quotidianamente frutta e verdura e il assume quotidianamente bevande zuccherate e gassate okkio alla salute tuttavia le scelte del singolo sono dettate anche dal contesto socio culturale cui si trova vivere soprattutto un ottica di globalizzazione e di rapida dis informazione tipica dei nostri tempo l uso sempre pi crescente dei mass medium come televisione radio anche e soprattutto del web hanno permesso un enorme disponibilit di notizie e contenuti anche di carattere sanitario secondo dati di okkio alla salute il dei bambino italiani trascorre mediamente pi di ore giorno davanti allo televisione tablet smartphone accordo con dati dello studio condotto da ipsos per save children che mostra come oltre il dei bambino italiani passa il proprio tempo attivit sedentarie e particolarmente di fronte alla televisione numerose sono le evidenze che dimostrano l importante ruolo che la pubblicit alimentare ha nell aumentare il rischio di obesit infantile questo perch induce un aumentato consumo di alimenti ad alto intake calorico e dal basso profilo nutrizionale oltre ridurre le ore trascorse attivit ludico motorie inol tre risulta crescente anche l utilizzo di nuove forme di medium come applicazioni per dispositivi mobili e social network cui si aggiunge anche l enorme successo dei programmi televisivi dedicati alla cucina e cibo generale cui bambino risultano essere protagonisti tuttavia mass medium non devono rappresentare solo un nemico da contrastare possono e devono costituire dei buoni alleati attraverso quali promuovere l educazione alimentare questo particolarmente vero se si considera che dispositivi tecnologici vengono principalmente utilizzati dai pi giovani recenti evidenze hanno dimostrato la loro efficacia nel promuovere le conoscenze legate sia agli aspetti nutrizionali degli alimenti anche alle capacit culinarie ad esempio l utilizzo di siti web informativi che disponevano per anche di giochi interattivi ha permesso diversi studi di far aumentare significativamente nel gruppo di intervento le conoscenze nutrizionali possedute anche di incrementare le scelte alimentari salutari questi tipi di interventi infatti hanno permesso questo modo non solo di migliorare le conoscenze anche le capacit stesse del soggetto importante risulta essere il potere che gli spot pubblicitari giochi hanno nel coinvolgere direttamente il bambino sono proprio le pubblicit cui bambino sono gli attori protagonisti riscuotere maggior popolarit questi elementi di successo messi atto dai medium potrebbero e dovrebbero essere utilizzati anche nei programmi di educazione alimentare rivolta ai bambino affinch questi ultimi possano raggiungere validi obiettivi nutrizionali un ulteriore strategia da tenere considerazione per comunicare modo efficacie ai pi piccoli il valore di una corretta alimentazione quella della gamification per gamification si intende l insieme di strumenti piattaforme e tecnologie che utilizzano le dinamiche proprie del gioco applicandole ad altri contesti fine di coinvolgere le persone su un tema specifico e motivarle cambiamento l utilizzo della gamification ambito di sicurezza nutrizionale si potrebbe definire come la strategia che consente attraverso l impiego di strumenti propri del game disign di migliorare le abitudini e comportamenti alimentari introdurre la gamification ambito nutrizionale pi generale quello sanitario potrebbe portare risultati positivi poich l interconnessione tra linguaggi diversi rende pi efficace la comunicazione e facilita il coinvolgimento della popolazione target particolare se si tratta di bambino questi strumenti riescono diffondere rapidamente alcuni messaggi poich catturano l attenzione dell utente stimolando il suo lato ludico e rendendo messaggi pi accessibili e divertenti una applicazione di quanto detto potrebbe essere l utilizzo di rappresentazioni teatrali finalizzate alla trasmissione di messaggi di educazione alimentare e cui gli attori sono bambino stessi il teatro infatti costituisce un occasione importante cui l apprendimento facilitato dal gioco inoltre molteplici sono gli aspetti che accomunano teatro e cibo primo tra tutti il corpo il corpo dell attore infatti elemento essenziale del teatro allo stesso tempo il cibo mantiene vita il corpo inoltre entrambi cibo e teatro costituiscono momenti di condivisione e convivialit il coinvolgimento emotivo e fisico che si raggiunge mediante il teatro permette un pi facile apprendimento tale da aumentare la propria consapevolezza e far che bambino diventino attori protagonisti delle proprie scelte alimentari consapevolezza delle scelte alimentari dei bambino che molto spesso assente infatti evidenze dimostrano che le bambino sono fortemente influenzati dai comportamenti alimentari dei genitori oltre che come detto dall ambiente circostante precedenti studi hanno dimostrato che il cibo fornito dai genitori come snack da consumare durante l orario scolastico non linea con le raccomandazioni sulla dieta sana inoltre bambino mangiano spesso cibi disponibili casa che vengono acquistati dai loro genitori caregiver ancora il ruolo dei genitori determinante nell attuazione di uno stile di vita sano poich questi costituiscono l esempio oltre che ad una condivisione di comportamenti infatti confrontando il bmi body mass index del bambino rispetto quello dei genitori si evince che quando almeno uno dei due genitori sovrappeso il dei bambino risulta sovrappeso e il obeso quando almeno un genitore obeso il dei bambino sovrappeso e il obeso tutto ci ha indotto l oms definire la prevenzione dell obesit come un obiettivo prioritario di salute pubblica tale scopo l oms identifica nei governi nei partner internazionali nella societ civile nelle organizzazioni non governative e nel settore privato soggetti grado di svolgere un ruolo determinante nel plasmare ambienti sani che possano facilitare le scelte di stili di vita pi salutari sia per bambino che per gli adolescenti emergenti evidenze infatti mostrano che coinvolgere direttamente gli stakeholder provenienti dalla societ civile e comunit locali svolga un ruolo fondamentale nello sviluppo di politiche di sanit pubblica incrementare la sicurezza nutrizionale particolare nell infanzia rappresenta una delle sfide pi serie della salute pubblica e per la quale necessario che tutti gli stakeholder promuovano uniti stili di vita salutari e abitudini acquisto salutari per il raggiungimento di tale obiettivo fondamentale che mezzi e le strategie messi campo ambito comunicativo siano sempre pi coinvolgenti fine di alimentare la motivazione cambiamento se il richiamo annuale per difterite e tetano era previsto anche nei precedenti calendari vaccinali il pnpv raccomanda l utilizzo per il richiamo decennale del vaccino combinato dtpa con l obiettivo di mantenere la protezione individuale verso difterite e tetano b semplificare la gestione delle ferite rischio di tetano evitando la somministrazione di immunoglobuline specifiche c rafforzare la protezione contro la pertosse attraverso l immunizzazione individuale e lo sviluppo dell immunit di gruppo recentemente stata infatti segnalata molti paesi europei una ri emergenza della pertosse italia l analisi delle schede di dimissione ospedaliera sdo dei ricoveri nazionali nel periodo ha evidenziato che il dei ricoveri per pertosse diagnosi principale ha coinvolto bambino sotto l anno di con un tasso di ospedalizzazione pari abitanti il richiamo dtap adulta oltre una protezione individuale permette attraverso l immunit di gruppo di contrastare la diffusione della pertosse nella comunit riducendo il rischio di pertosse nei neonati e loro familiari e rappresenta insieme alla vaccinazione con dtap nella donna gravidanza uno strumento importante per proteggere nuovi nati da un infezione che mostra un elevato tasso di complicanze e letalit questa fascia di per quanto riguarda il tetano secondo quanto riportato nell ultimo rapporto del centro europeo per il controllo e la prevenzione delle malattie european centre disease prevention control ecdc italia nel quinquennio sono stati notificati casi di tetano dei quali verificatisi pazienti ultrasessantacinquenni questi casi rappresentano il di tutti casi notificati europa nello stesso periodo infine la vaccinazione rimane l unico strumento utile per la prevenzione della difterite permettendo di riportare livelli sierici della popolazione generale valori protettivi e non rischiare nuove epidemie studi sieroepidemiologici hanno dimostrato che livelli anticorpali adulta tendono diminuire diventando nel tempo non protettivi con la riduzione della protezione vaccinale si rischia nella popolazione adulta la diffusione di c diphtheriae e c ulcerans attraverso la circolazione di individui provenienti da paesi cui la difterite endemica il pnpv raccomanda di offrire attivamente il richiamo per dtap alla popolazione adulta sfruttando ogni occasione opportuna per l offerta della vaccinazione incluse le visite mediche presso il proprio medico di famiglia anche per certificazioni di vario tipo il mmg rimane il punto di riferimento per suoi assistiti negli ultimi anni per le malattie croniche sono stati avviati molti progetti di presa carico del paziente percorsi diagnostico tera peutici assitenziale pdta intregrati tra territorio e ospedale cui il mmg gioca un ruolo fondamentale nella gestione del paziente dalla diagnosi alla cura alla prevenzione delle complicanze assistenza nella fase avanzata della malattia il ruolo del mmg pu rivestire un ruolo fondamentale non soltanto per quanto riguarda la cura dei pazienti e la prevenzione terziaria anche nella prevenzione primaria e secondaria inclusa la promozione e l offerta vaccinale nonostante italia non vengano sistematicamente raccolti dati di copertura vaccinale adulta eccetto che per l influenza possiamo ragionevolmente affermare che programmi di immunizzazione questa fascia di non siano consolidati basti pensare che la copertura vaccinale per l influenza supera di poco il nonostante la campagna di vaccinazione antinfluenzale abbia una storia ventennale e coinvolga attivamente mmg nella asl di latina fine di favorire l adesione alla vaccinazione antitetanica adulta aggiunta offerta della vaccinazione presso servizi vaccinali marzo stato disegnato un percorso strutturato di offerta attiva della vaccinazione dtpa alla popolazione adulta mediante un progetto integrato tra il distretto e il dipartimento di prevenzione servizio di igiene e sanit pubblica che pone il medico di medicina generale come promotore e vaccinatore del richiamo dtpa lo studio si prefigge seguenti obiettivi garantire l offerta attiva e gratuita della vaccinazione dtap nella popolazione adulto anche attraverso forme di revisione e di miglioramento dell efficienza dell approvvigionamento e della logistica del sistema vaccinale aventi come scopo il raggiungimento e il mantenimento delle coperture valutare la fattibilit di un modello organizzativo che preveda l offerta e somministrazione del richiamo dtap adulta attraverso il mmg aumentare la consapevolezza da parte del mmg dell importanza della prevenzione condividere un percorso virtuoso di collaborazione tra assistenza primaria distretti dipartimenti di prevenzione e servizi vaccinali della asl obiettivo secondario l incremento delle coperture vaccinali per il richiamo dtap nella popolazione target dello studio lo studio stato strutturato quattro fasi nella prima fase di analisi del contesto e disegno dello studio sono stati contattati gli attori coinvolti distretto dipartimento di prevenzione identificati referenti di asl prodotto il materiale informativo brochure e locandine da distribuire presso gli ambulatori medici disegnato il modello organizzativo e definiti gli indicatori di processo ed esito come popolazione target della sperimentazione sono state identificate le coorti di nascita fine di garantire l inclusione di soggetti che dovrebbero aver effettuato un ciclo primario di vaccinazione antitetanica la cui obbligatoriet stata introdotta italia nel il modello organizzativo prevede una remunerazione base per il mmg per ogni vaccinazione effettuata questa fase inoltre sono state selezionate le unit di cure primarie ucp partecipanti progetto su base volontaria il modello stato illustrato occasione di un incontro con mmg cui stato richiesto di esprimere la volont di partecipare progetto nel periodo luglio settembre si svolta la seconda fase di produzione cui il progetto stato presentato alle ucp partecipanti attraverso un incontro cui stato illustrato il valore della vaccinazione difterite tetano pertosse sono stati presentatati dati di immunogenicit efficacia e sicurezza del vaccino illustrato il progetto con dettagli tecnici relativamente ai criteri di inclusione della popolazione target e alla modalit di offerta e somministrazione della vaccinazione fornita la documentazione necessaria per la procedura vaccinale scheda anamnestica e raccolta del consenso informato registrazione dei dati relativi individuo e alla vaccinazione somministrata modulistica per la segnalazione di eventuali reazioni avverse questa fase mmg hanno selezionato tra loro assistiti nati nel periodo come popolazione target dell offerta la terza fase operativa avr inizio ottobre attraverso l offerta e somministrazione della vaccinazione di richiamo dtpa dal mmg ai propri assistiti presso il proprio ambulatorio il mmg coglier ogni occasione opportuna di contatto con gli assistiti afferenti alla popolazione target dell offerta per verificare lo stato vaccinale ed eseguir la vaccinazione nel corso della visita stessa fissando un appuntamento l anamnesi permetter medico di confermare l aver effettuato passato un ciclo vaccinale primario modo da poter somministrare soltanto una dose booster raccomandando un richiamo anni nell ultima fase di valutazione l adesione alla vaccinazione attraverso il modello proposto verr valutata come percentuale di adulti vaccinati con dtpa sul totale degli assistiti del mmg appartenenti alle coorti identificate e verr predisposto un rapporto dettagliato dello studio due ucp comprendenti mmg hanno espresso adesione volontaria progetto per un numero totale di assistiti pari la popolazione target complessiva cio gli assistiti nati nel periodo e quindi potenziali candidati alla vaccinazione pari la valutazione critica del progetto ha identificato una serie di vantaggi per le figure interessate gli assistiti il mmg servizi vaccinali e il sistema sanitario regionale portare l offerta vaccinale presso gli ambulatori del mmg significa andare incontro ai bisogni degli assistiti che possono avvalersi del rapporto di fiducia con il proprio medico curante e della logistica facilitata frequentando lo studio del mmg per altri motivi assistenziali non devono recarsi specificamente presso un servizio vaccinale per la sola vaccinazione dtpa il mmg pu ampliare le proprie conoscenze e competenze professionali e contribuire raggiungimento di obiettivi di sanit pubblica gli operatori sanitari dei servizi vaccinali possono reimpiegare le risorse liberate nella programmazione di altre attivit di promozione vaccinale infine come sopra menzionato la vaccinazione dtpa effettuata secondo il pnpv costituisce un lea ed pertanto da garantire il modello organizzativo proposto promuoverebbe il dialogo tra assistiti e mmg materia vaccinale co da favorire l adesione consapevole dei soggetti adulti alla vaccinazione dtpa e pi generale alle vaccinazioni previste dal pnpv con indubbi vantaggi di sanit pubblica aumentando le coperture per dtpa si contrasta la morbosit del tetano e della pertosse con conseguente riduzione dei costi sanitari diretti legati ai ricoveri per talus patologie e si garantisce una pi corretta gestione del paziente pronto soccorso caso di traumatismi con ferite rischio di tetano attraverso una migliore appropriatezza terapeutica e riduzione del consumo di

le coperture nei soggetti adulti popolazione target dello studio e di valutare la fattibilit di questo modello organizzativo prevenzione dm sono tecnici delle prevenzione ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro tdp e gli assistenti sanitari essi svolgono le attivit ancorate alle responsabilit derivanti dai profili professionali declarati nei e e pur dovendosi ruoli e le funzioni professionali declinare maniera differenziata seconda della regione cui si eroga la formazione relazione alle specificit e alle peculiarit del contesto territoriale l attenzione alle attivit di prevenzione elemento cardine le professioni della prevenzione hanno un importanza strategica per la salute delle popolazioni tutto il territorio nazionale rispetto alla dimensione etica delle promozione e della salute anche terminus di dignit della persona oltre che per le ricadute economiche delle attivit di prevenzione l investimento sulla sicurezza delle popolazioni nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro si traduce infatti un ritorno positivo sia terminus di salute guadagnata che un risparmio di costi per la cura delle patologie ed altre spese indirette ciononostante alcune realt si osserva che il supporto delle istituzioni pubbliche nell erogazione del corso di laurea particolare dei tirocini appare insufficiente pi generale il tiepido interesse delle istituzioni verso le professioni di tdp e malgrado la riconosciuta rilevanza dell attivit sul territorio tutela della salute e della sicurezza potrebbe costituire una criticit insieme alla non completa attuazione per ci che riguarda le asl delle norme istitutive del dipartimento delle professioni sanitarie con l evidenza che l istituzione della unit operativa complessa dell area della prevenzione appare disomogenea nelle asl del lazio e italia se da una parte corsi di laurea delle professioni sanitarie della prevenzione rappresentano elemento fondante della terza missione dell universit dall altra corsi di laurea attivati differenti atenei manifestano difficolt nel colmare il gap tra l universit ed il mondo del lavoro la creazione di reti di imprese presso le quali gli studenti oltre svolgere il tirocinio professionalizzante possano svolgere anche esperienze di tirocinio post lauream potrebbe costituire valore aggiunto la scarsa conoscenza del profilo professionale del tdp da parte dei datori di lavoro alcune piccole e medie imprese della normativa materia di sicurezza che si traduce nell affidamento dei compiti che dovrebbe svolgere un tdp ad altre figure professionali gi presenti nell impresa prive di specifico background e formazione costituisce un ulteriore elemento di criticit riferimento alle asl il ruolo e la funzione del tdp e dell appaiono non completamente definite con il rischio di una confusione di ruoli responsabilit e professionalit e di un aumento della burocratizzazione delle attivit dei dipartimenti di prevenzione salvo caso di presenza di una dirigenza illuminata dove il tdp e l possono contribuire conseguire un pi elevato livello di qualit dell assistenza ed elevati standard di stili di vita nella popolazione secondo la nostra esperienza nello specifico del corso di laurea tecniche della prevenzione ambiente nei luoghi di lavoro dell universit cattolica del sacro cuore sede di roma la modernit della professione che viene percepita da tutti gli studenti sin dal primo anno di corso con autentico interesse verso gli argomenti di insegnamento e generale verso le tematiche della sicurezza costituisce un punto di forza del percorso formativo ci contrasto con l evidenza che alcune aziende pubbliche vi un ritardo nel processo di modernizzazione della figura del tdp che di fatto spesso svolge il ruolo amministrativo di vigile sanitario se vero che il tdp affonda le sue radici storiche nel regio decreto che istituisce la figura del vigile sanitario per coadiuvare l ufficiale sanitario nell esecuzione delle ispezioni igienico sanitarie e dei regolamenti comunali e vigili sanitari erano inquadrati come corpo di polizia dotati di una propria divisa dipendevano gerarchicamente dal comandante dei vigili urbani per quanto concernente la loro disciplina e dall ufficiale sanitario per quanto riguarda l espletamento del loro servizio ad oggi lo scenario epidemiologico demografico professionale e normativo si modificato secondo anche l impostazione del l vo cui l approccio repressivo deve mutare un nuovo approccio anche culturale verso la prevenzione proattiva intesa come valore ad esempio il corso di laurea tdp dell universit cattolica grazie anche alla lungimiranza del direttore delle attivit professionalizzanti l unico corso di studi dell universit cattolica che prevede l alternanza scuola lavoro e che investe nel tirocinio presso piccole imprese locali nel tentativo di innescare un circolo virtuoso tra l universit e il territorio favorire l integrazione dei tdp sul territorio ed servizi aziendali di risk management e della prevenzione e protezione per collaborare mantenimento dei livelli di qualit delle prestazioni erogate dal servizio pubblico costituisce certamente un ulteriore sfida positiva la crisi che oggi le professioni della prevenzione vivono certamente anche legata fatto che il profilo del tdp contenuto nel confusamente formulato particolare laddove la declaratoria prevede che tecnici della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro svolgono la loro attivit professionale regime di dipendenza libero professionale nell ambito del servizio sanitario nazionale presso tutti servizi di prevenzione controllo e vigilanza previsti dalla normativa vigente di fatto sembra escludere che tecnici della prevenzione possano operare negli altri settori diversi dalla sanit ne deriva che presso datori di lavoro privati di fatto le funzioni dei tecnici della prevenzione sono spesso svolte da ingegneri e che di fatto il corso di laurea ingegneria ambientale e della sicurezza sia il principale competitor del corso di laurea tecniche della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro ci si aggiunga che nelle aziende pubbliche si registra spesso la presenza di dirigenti ingegneri prevalentemente nei servizi di prevenzione e salute nei luoghi di lavoro che di fatto svolgono funzioni dirigenziali che dovrebbero dalle suddette dirigenze illuminate essere affidati professionisti dell area della prevenzione con riferimento settore pubblico dai dati sull occupazione particolare dai dati pubblicati dalla ragioneria generale dello stato sul profilo di operatore di vigilanza e protezione risulta che il tdp il profilo professionale pi vecchio tra tdp impiegati nel infatti professionisti pi giovani hanno anni si stima inoltre che entro il si pensioner circa il dei professionisti alle dipendenze del ci si aggiunge il fondato timore del ridimensionamento dei servizi di prevenzione e protezione del entro prossimi cinque anni si evidenzia inoltre che gli studenti e docenti della scuola secondaria superiore non conoscono il corso di laurea tecniche della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro pertanto necessaria un operazione di orientamento ingresso mirata agli studenti delle scuole superiori fondamentale sarebbe ad esempio nelle scuole la valorizzazione della funzione di promozione della salute per il contrasto del consumo di droga alcol per una sana alimentazione per la promozione vaccinale per lo sviluppo di una cultura ambientale con riferimento piano degli studi del corso di laurea tecniche della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro dell ucsc malgrado l indubbia qualit della formazione e dei contenuti si rileva che vi sia un sovraccarico cognitivo evidenziato da una sovrabbondanza di ssd apprezzabile che nel piano degli studi l ucsc abbia rispettato il principio della sussunzione delle discipline tecniche sotto il ssd affidate ai professionisti del settore della prevenzione riguardo piani di studio sarebbe auspicabile uniformare gli stessi creando reti universitarie che pianifichino uniformemente percorsi di studi sia nel percorso triennale che magistrale per cui l offerta almeno nella regione lazio andrebbe ottimizzata e tarata sulle esigenze degli studenti lavoratori che spesso vi si iscrivono utile appare tale senso l individuazione di livelli essenziali di insegnamento che consentono da un lato di evitare il sovraccarico formativo e dall altro lato di agire direttamente sui contenuti degli insegnamenti con docenti che li erogano critica potrebbe apparire la sussunzione della disciplina deontologia e regolamentazione sotto il ssd anzich sotto il ssd il che assicurerebbe probabilmente una migliore attenzione alle specificit deontologiche del profilo professionale quando queste siano state definite dagli specifici ordini e albi professionali la professione del tecnico della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro riconosciuta e considerata vari provvedimenti normativi dal miur dal ministero della salute dal mise e dal ministero del lavoro e delle politiche sociali cionondimeno l italia l unico paese che non ha mai adottato una strategia nazionale per la sicurezza nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro si rileva l urgenza di creare un tavolo politico sui temi dell ambiente del tutto trascurati sinergia anche con datori di lavoro istituzionalmente forti mise confindustria valorizzando il ruolo delle regioni quale interlocutore principale con riferimento alla sinergia tra le imprese e l universit per tirocini formativi sarebbe utile la formulazione di un piano incentivante per tutor che potrebbe consistere per esempio nella creazione di un albo dei tutor gestito dall ordine professionale che possa agevolare dette figure nell accesso ai crediti per la formazione continuum ecm attribuiti per l impegno tutoriale ovvero nella previsione di compensi poich il piano degli studi prevede uno specifico insegnamento sull ambiente le l arpa dovrebbero considerare gli studenti del corso di laurea tecniche della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro ai fini dello svolgimento del tirocinio professionalizzante atteso che base art comma del il tecnico della prevenzione nell ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro svolge la sua attivit professionale regime di dipendenza libero professionale nell ambito del servizio sanitario nazionale presso tutti servizi di prevenzione controllo e vigilanza previsti dalla normativa vigente si auspica che l istituzione dell ordine e dell albo professionale possa contribuire alla sensibilizzazione delle istituzioni pubbliche e delle imprese private sull importanza della professione e del contributo anche culturale alla prevenzione conclusione la sfida come ha sostenuto il prof walter ricciardi gi presidente dell iss e coordinatore della struttura didattica del corso di laure tecniche delle prevenzione ambiente e nei luoghi di lavoro dell universit cattolica del sacro cuore fino occasione della sua nomina presidente della world federation public health association quella di trasformare la tutela della salute un istanza presente tutte le politiche educative ambientali industriali poich solo co possibile costruire sistemi sanitari equi e sostenibili anche nel futuro fondamentale comprendere come la scelta sia politica e non economica oltre che culturale solo co si pu auspicare di dere finalmente nella sanit non solo un costo e interpretare il concetto di sanit per tutti oltre il mero investimento economico la sanit sintonia con la direzione generale dell oms quella della sanit come fattore di sviluppo di un paese sia esso ricco disagiato infatti dimostrato che un paese sano lavora di pi produce di pi e spende di meno per le malattie professionisti della prevenzione hanno il compito di far comprendere questa evidenza che contribuisce valore della sanit pubblica cui la prevenzione dovrebbe essere protagonista modalit equa e sostenibile co da poter adottare decisioni conseguenti con principali interlocutori economici mise perch solo con un cambio di visione da sanit come fattore di costo fattore di sviluppo che si potr sperare un salto avanti nell approccio verso l obiettivo della copertura sanitarium universale segnando di fatto la sconfitta della visione della sanit di mercato favore invece di una sanit globale realmente permeante dal punto di vista sociale la sfida e la scommessa della salute tutte le politiche sostenibile poich dimostrato che per ogni dollari investiti prevenzione sanitarium ne tornano paese dai agli il tutto curando sempre le abilit comunicative dei

prevenzione minaccia organizzativa opportunit di miglioramento v marcotrigiano azienda sanitaria locale bt barletta andria trani nella nostra societ scientifica si dibatte da pi di un quinquennio di task shifting cui principi possono non trovare immediata applicazione poich nel sistema complesso cui si trovano ad operare le aziende del servizio sanitario nazionale necessario aprirsi ad un cambiamento che spesso fatica concretizzarsi se la ridistribuzione razionale dei compiti interno di un gruppo di lavoro sanitario grazie alla quale competenze tecniche specifiche sono spostate da operatori sanitari qualificazione formale pi elevata ad altri di qualificazione formale meno elevata pu apparire una definizione che richiama esclusivamente ad aspetti organizzativi sempre necessario valutare preliminarmente e con spirito critico punti di forza e le aree di miglioramento che insistono nel sistema complesso cui opera personale afferente servizi e dipartimenti che erogano prestazioni volta alla tutela della collettivit per poter apportare migliorie ad un contesto organizzativo sanitario necessario sostenere e continuare sensibilizzare vertici aziendali nella costante adozione di politiche decisionali utili rendere le prestazioni territoriali maggiormente efficienti promuovere l individuazione delle linee operative cui possibile ipotizzare l attuazione del task shifting e studiare strategie volta vincere resistenza cambiamento ed contrastare le abitudini sono state ad oggi individuate e descritte numerose linee di lavoro dei dipartimenti di prevenzione cui principi del task shifting trovano concreta applicazione diversi contesti aziendali l obiettivo strategico comune seppure apparentemente faticoso volto migliorare il sistema prevenzione valorizzando

previsto dagli specifici profili professionali manager super manager nel futuro delle direzioni l bertinato istituto superiore di sanit roma fulop e ramsay bmj hanno evidenziato come nei cambiamenti organizzativi il corretto uso dei dati e della tecnologia da parte dei manager sanitari guida il miglioramento della qualit del sistema sanitario e patient outcome prescindere se questo avvenga livello nazionale regionale il nuovo manager sanitario del sia esso di direzione strategica oppure middle manager e quindi di ospedale di distretto del dipartimento di prevenzione svolge un ruolo chiave nelle aziende sanitarie con nuove sfide professionali quanto ruolo ibrido tra quanto previsto dallo storico l super manager della sanit c molti casi frutto delle sfide legate introduzione dell

come l impresa istituzioni pubbliche e cittadini su temi sanitari pur mantenendo centrale la collegialit del lavoro della direzione strategica fine di raggiungere modo sistemico ed efficace gli obiettivi aziendali diventa fondamentale investire un middle management aziendale moderno grado di presidiare attraverso il coordinamento diretto la collaborazione con altri servizi aziendali una serie di nucleus di attivit dallo sviluppo strategico value management dalle relazioni con gli stakeholder alla valorizzazione del capitale umano alla gestione operativa alle funzioni di garanzia e vigilanza tra ospedale dipartimento di prevenzione e distretto socio sanitario il manager sanitario del futuro dovr potersi avvalere di professionisti grado di affrontare le sfide della gestione delle nuove grandi aziende sanitarie frutto dei grandi accorpamenti territoriali della filosofia del bigger better con competenze tecniche quand anche tradizionali totalmente rinnovate ed una sviluppata expertise manageriale con riferimento alle professionalit tra le prime si fa riferimento la gestione operativa che comprende gli approcci e strumenti relativi alla gestione degli asset produttivi

legale mentre dall altro regola e garantisce la gestione della qualit e dell accreditamento sia esso istituzionale di eccellenza inoltre relazione proprio ruolo di guida e connettore dei processi di produzione tra le funzioni con cui il manager sanitario deve collaborare strettamente per la definizione di politiche comuni di azione vi sono l area ospedaliera l area socio sanitarium e della prevenzione assieme quella delle professioni sanitarie per ricondurre ad unitariet la gestione della produzione dei servizi sanitari e socio sanitari nei suoi riflessi sul personale medico infermieristico e dei tecnici della prevenzione la programmazione e controllo e flussi informativi sanitari compresa la rendicontazione degli outcome clinici e degli esiti allo scopo di costruire un cruscotto unitario di programmazione e controllo delle performance produttive e sanitarie dell azienda la gestione e sviluppo del capitale umano con una forte connessione con le articolazioni organizzative dell azienda che si occupano di gestione delle risorse umane sia mediche sia infermieristiche sia le nuove professioni e della formazione le relazioni sindacali che pur gestite dal punto di vista strategico dalla direzione generale necessitano di un coordinamento che garantisca la connessione tra le politiche discusse dalla dg e analizzi le ripercussioni sulla gestione dell operativit aziendale garantita dalla ds l ufficio tecnico per le questioni riguardanti la progettazione edilizia la ristrutturazione dei luoghi e degli spazi criteri infrastrutturali e la dotazione tecnologica solo il coordinamento tra chi conosce le dinamiche reali delle attivit sanitarie e chi deputato agli investimenti infrastrutturali e tecnologici potr condurre politiche efficaci di progettazione degli edifici e dei luoghi dove si produce salute relazione alle necessit dei professionisti e dei pazienti questo scenario si inseriscono le nuove competenze legate alla gestione dell innovazione

distretto socio sanitario con l avvento delle nuove tecnologie intelligenti e gli algoritmi predittivi ne esce quindi un super manager di direzione strategica e un super middle manager che dovr formarsi prevalentemente e necessariamente sul campo momento l offerta accademica prevalentemente post specializzazione oppure andando estero tutte grandi sfide per questi manager sanitari del che per saper rispondere tutti collaboratori tempo reale li trasformeranno professionisti sempre pi digitali con il risultato di creare un manager della direzione strategica sempre meno avvicinabile dal middle manager e un middle manager sempre meno avvicinabile dai direttori di struttura complessa questo dibattito sull evoluzione del manager sanitario troppo pochi si stanno impegnando per riconfigurarlo e profilarlo forse perch l evoluzione del ruolo e delle responsabilit del manager e super manager sono troppo rapide per essere presentate maniera ultimativa nelle sedi educazionali tradizionali tuttavia utile ricordare che l art comma b e c del nuovo statuto della prevede un apposito ruolo della societ nel favorire l evoluzione e lo sviluppo culturale e professionale degli igienisti cooperazione con l amministrazione sanitarium e le istituzioni mediche e scientifiche nazionali ed internazionali che la chiama prepotentemente causa forte della sua storia nella sanit pubblica italiana particolare la siti potrebbe guidare il dibattito nazionale per cercare risposte alle seguenti domande come ridurre la distanza tra super manager della direzione strategica del e il middle management questione chiave per la gestione delle aziende sanitarie territoriali e ospedaliero universitarie del futuro quale riqualificazione formativa dei manager ruolo per innalzare rapidamente il loro livello professionale per adeguarlo evoluzione organizzativa e tecnologica dei sistemi sanitari quale ruolo dovr avere il direttore del dipartimento di prevenzione di fronte queste sfide tecnologiche e gestionali atto per non trovarsi margine delle priorit gestionali dell azienda sanitarium l occasione del congresso mondiale di sanit pubblica di roma propizia per presentare queste risposte frutto della cultura gestionale delle direzioni strategiche di presidio ospedaliero di distretto socio sanitario e del dipartimento di prevenzione del sistema sanitario nazionale e

competenze professionali igienistiche e skill manageriali dei medici delle direzioni mediche ospedaliere dmo nell organizzazione sanitarium del futuro occorre considerare le profonde trasformazioni atto nell ospedale e il singolare quadro delle dmo chiamate ad operare un contesto normativo datato frammentato e privo di un univoco quadro di riferimento l ospedale un organizzazione complessa strutturata come tutte le burocrazie professionali sulla base di forti regole implicite spesso autoreferenziale e poco incline cambiamento se non per le innovazioni di carattere clinico assistenziale zanetti tuttavia negli ultimi due decenni nell ambito dei sistemi sanitari pi evoluti l ospedale ha dovuto accettare la sfida del cambiamento imposta da un mutato contesto economico socio demografico epidemiologico e tecnologico le profonde transizioni atto nei paesi occidentali e la necessit di confrontarsi con problemi di sostenibilit con l invecchiamento della popolazione l aumento delle patologie cronico degenerative e dei pazienti pluripatologici e contempo con continui progressi tecnologici le nuove conoscenze cliniche e le crescenti attese dei cittadini rendono ineluttabile un cambio di paradigma del sistema ospedaliero e l adozione di parallele innovazioni organizzative il ruolo strategico dell ospedale cambiato e continuer mutare nel prossimo futuro le attivit di medium complessit trovano efficaci risposte nell assistenza territoriale con il progressivo potenziamento dei servizi distrettuali mentre l ospedale deputato sempre pi alla cura delle patologie acute complesse con perdita definitiva delle precedenti caratteristiche generaliste nel suo ambito si sperimentano modelli organizzativi alternativi rigide settorializzazioni disciplinari e professionali e si definiscono nuovi asseti organizzativi e nuovi obiettivi di servizio l adozione del modello dipartimentale dell ospedale per intensit di cure l integrazione rete dei presidi di diverso livello la promozione dei centri di eccellenza la definizione di pdta e di accordi interaziendali rappresentano obiettivi ancora itinere sono coerenti con concetti di committenza sempre meno orientati semplice governo della produzione e pi sensibili alla tutela della salute terminus di equit di accesso appropriatezza clinica sicurezza continuit assistenziale e presa carico della persona la sfida dell innovazione imposta da un tale scenario richiede tuttavia un insieme combinato di interventi capaci di favorire l affermazione di nuovi modelli manageriali e organizzativi ed una effettiva metamorfosi culturale molto proclamata che nei fatti procede pi lentamente di quanto dovrebbe sia nell area della programmazione che nella cultura del management e dei molti professionisti della sanit pieroni l emanazione del dm sugli standard ospedalieri e del piano cronicit nel e con evidente ritardo rispetto ad un quadro rapida evoluzione segna comunque un punto di non ritorno rispetto recente passato cambiamenti atto avranno un forte impatto sul ruolo e sulle prospettive professionali dei medici igienisti delle dmo che partire dagli anni ottanta accanto alla classica componente di tipo igienico organizzativo hanno assunto un ruolo distinto nell ambito manageriale gestionale zanetti successivamente sancito dall avvio dell aziendalizzazione per accettare e vincere la sfida del futuro tuttavia fondamentale ridisegnare e affermare per questi professionisti un ruolo meno eterogeneo ed ambiguo dell attuale ed contempo sviluppare sia nel percorso formativo dei giovani colleghi che nell aggiornamento continuo nuove competenze che congiunte quelle tradizionali gi patrimonio dei medici igienisti sappiano rispondere ai nuovi bisogni delle nostre organizzazioni nell ultimo decennio sono sorte le premesse per una significativa revisione del ruolo e delle responsabilit attribuite alla dmo assenza di un quadro univoco di sistema si assistito ad una progressiva delegificazione e deregulation della funzione che ha generato ambiguit e non sempre consente di individuare con chiarezza quali siano gli ambiti di responsabilit e le competenze da mettere campo diverse indagini dimostrano un ampia variabilit di modelli ed una vasta gamma di soluzioni riguardo la collocazione organizzativa ed il ruolo della dmo sia nell ambito dei sistemi sanitari regionali che nelle realt di una stessa regione pieroni questa situazione che riflette asincronie e incertezze tipiche delle fasi di transizione da mettere relazione decentramento regionale autonomia organizzativa riconosciuta alle aziende ed potere discrezionale dei vertici aziendali anche peso decisivo delle trasformazioni che hanno interessato l organizzazione dell ospedale particolare l affermazione del modello dipartimentale la transizione professionale con riconoscimento di pi ampie autonomie gestionali alla componente clinica infermieristica e tecnica la crescente specializzazione dei servizi di staff alle direzioni aziendali oggi che tale riassetto stato sperimentato e si consolidato nella maggioranza delle occorre porsi l obiettivo di rendere sinergiche e complementari le nuove figure gestionali rappresentate da professionisti dell area clinica assistenziale e tecnica e quella dei medici che tradizionalmente hanno svolto e svolgono funzioni organizzative tale riguardo sembra convincente il quadro concettuale per l analisi delle funzioni della dmo descritto dal rapporto oasi pi volta ripreso nella letteratura di settore che individua quattro direttrici asset management knowledge management disease management e network management su cui fondare l organizzazione e la gestione dell ospedale trasformazione lega questo quadro di trasformazione tra altre ipotesi meno suggestive e anche sulla base di ricerche empiriche la letteratura propone una rappresentazione della dmo impegnata attorno due grandi aree di sua stretta pertinenza ed attorno ad altre aree contendibili con altre linee direzionali professionali le aree di specifica competenza che assimilano la dmo ad una direzione della produzione sono quella dei medical affair e quella dell operation management la prima rappresenta l area delle funzioni stretto collegamento con la linea clinica programmazione e controllo gestione dei flussi informativi supporto audit clinico valutazione degli esiti hta orientamento allo sviluppo professionale rapporto e dipendenza con le strategie aziendali la seconda attiene alla gestione operativa ossia alla funzione che ricerca le migliori condizioni di efficienza dell ospedale sotto il profilo tecnico e gestionale organizzazione di infrastrutture diagnostiche e terapeutiche tecnologiche logistica e dei processi complessi e sovraordinati quale l accreditamento l igiene ospedaliera gli investimenti e che vede la dmo centro dei processi decisionali le aree contendibili riguardano ambiti altrettanto complessi non prettamente specialistici e che quindi necessitano di alti livelli di collaborazione con altre professioni qualit risk management gestione dei posti letto con le direzioni tecnico amministrative personale acquisti marketing comunicazione libera professione relazioni sindacali con pi direzioni contemporaneamente come nel caso di progetti speciali relativi riorganizzazioni reti interaziendali trasformazioni strutturali anche questi ambiti cui la collegialit ed il coinvolgimento dei clinici rappresenta un indiscusso punto di forza il contributo dei medici di dmo pu assicurare un apporto terzo oltre che competenze e sensibilit talus da porlo spesso posizione di leadership fantini prospettiva l obiettivo potrebbe essere quello di costruire una dmo grado di esercitare le proprie funzioni talus diversi ambiti una logica di direzione operativa dell ospedale e di team multiprofessionale che comprenda altre figure infermieri ingegneri gestionali statistici e dove il medico di organizzazione assume ruolo e responsabilit

ambiti di responsabilit ai diversi livelli dell organizzazione evitando inefficienti sovrapposizioni l indirizzo strategico capo alla direzione aziendale la gestione della produzione e delle attivit di supporto alla direzione operativa la gestione delle attivit core clinico assistenziali affidata con gradi di autonomia sempre pi ampi alle direzioni dipartimentali ed assistenziali qualsiasi sia l ambito di azione e di responsabilit della dmo fattori di successo del futuro saranno contenuti e le conoscenze che sapr offrire ai propri interlocutori e le modalit di confronto con le altre componenti professionali la matrice igienistica e l approccio ai grandi temi della sanit pubblica dei mo uno dei presupposti per affrontare meglio le prossime sfide che comunque potranno essere vinte solo se l approccio sar basato su solide basi scientifiche maturate nel corso della formazione specialistica e dell attivit professionale il sapere scientifico deve essere migliorato per massimizzare risultati e ridurre minimo rischi di indeterminazione e inappropriatezza la posta gioco e cambiamenti atto nell ospedale esigono lo sviluppo di ulteriori e pi solide competenze rispetto oggi diversi

dell ict e dell informazione diffusa un abilit del tutto particolare che pu essere appresa che dovrebbe essere discriminata gi nella fase di valutazione delle attitudini di chi aspira ad operare nelle dmo la capacit di comunicare caratteristica decisiva per un efficace interazione con decisori il management strategico le direzioni dipartimentali la popolazione il tema della formazione universitaria e post universitaria cruciale per accompagnare il processo di rinnovamento auspicato da anni corso un serrato confronto sull impianto delle scuole di specializzazione e le soluzioni via via adottate non sembrano ancora rispondere appieno alle esigenze del ssn la scuola di specializzazione igiene e medicina preventiva rappresenta la base su cui sviluppare l acquisizione delle conoscenze e competenze che abbiamo delineato come necessarie per medici delle dmo tuttavia diverse indagini hanno rivelato che nei fatti piani formativi possono essere molto differenti nelle diverse sedi e non sempre efficaci rispetto agli scopi costantini questo quadro deve essere rapidamente modificato con una concreta revisione dei piani di studio e delle reti formative anche funzione di una efficace applicazione dei dettami della legge che prevede per gli specializzandi dell ultimo anno la possibilit di partecipare ai concorsi di selezione ed essere assunti td nell ambito delle aziende del ssn la nuova normativa segue alcuni principi gi sperimentati livello internazionale dove peraltro la maggioranza delle scuole di public health non contemplano il management ospedaliero riservando la formazione tale ambito corsi e master precisamente codificati questa ulteriore strada comincia ad essere seguita anche nel nostro paese con investimenti pi strutturati per l aggiornamento continuo e per corsi di management sanitario post universitari ed un opportunit che va perseguita anche allo scopo di coinvolgere progressivamente altri professionisti della salute impegnati attivit gestionali non si creda per che tutti gli autori siano concordi nel credere ciecamente nel valore degli investimenti questo settore non mancano le voci critiche quali quella di spicer spicer berinato che critica il mito del manager maratoneta reale virtuale fanatico degli stili di vita sani e del fitness fisico e ricorda come programmi di promozione della salute e dell attivit fisica troppo intrusivi opprimenti possano rivelarsi inutili addirittura controproducenti portando ad una forma di senso di inadeguatezza ansiet colpa negli impiegati tuttavia anche questo autore co critico verso il marketing aggressivo del wellness riconosce che programmi semplici basati sulla presenza di una palestra di piccoli impianti interno degli ambienti lavorativi e che si pongano obiettivi realistici e non sovradimensionati possono anche portare benefici rilevanti l idea di promuovere attivit fisica piccole palestre ed eventi sportivi ai quali possano partecipare anche parenti dei dipendenti discussa anche da autori come das das che ricordano come programmi di sola erogazione di attivit motoria che non abbiano impatto sul tessuto sociale aziendale e sulla promozione di ambienti di lavoro che promuovano coerentemente gli stili di vita attivi non hanno grandi probabilit di raggiungere esiti positivi una grande attenzione ai programmi di allenamento inviduali e accesso facilitato alla palestra e alle strutture sportive aziendali l impiego di allenatori qualificati il controllo annuale medico e di counselling nutrizionale la possibilit per dipendenti di partecipare su base volontaria e gratuita programma la presenza di una ambulatorio medico interno dello stabilimento adeguato anche allo svolgimento delle prove di valutazione funzionale propedeutiche esercizio docenti e ricercatori che operano nei corsi di laurea dell area delle scienze motorie e dell universit di cassino e del lazio meridionale hanno avuto occasione questi ultimi anni di collaborare con med ex nelle

che prevede tra gli altri nel curriculum denominato attivit fisica adattata insegnamenti specificamente indirizzati formare quegli allenatori qualificati citati come elemento fondamentale per il successo dei programmi di corporate wellness capaci di effettuare insieme ad una equipe medica adeguate prove di valutazione funzionale e di progettare e monitorare attivit motorie tagliate su misura

hanno recepito le raccomandazioni dei massimi organismi scientifici internazionali definendo il piano nazionale della prevenzione pnp sua volta recepito nei vari piani regionali della prevenzione prp perch l attivit motoria possa essere implementata maniera significativa ed efficace sul territorio quale elemento di promozione della salute bisogna che vengano realizzate iniziative intersettoriali che vedano coinvolti le istituzioni pubbliche e private tutti livelli il terzo settore le reti sociali la societ civile gli enti di promozione sportiva le regioni comuni tal fine nelle regioni sono stati attivati vari progetti caratterizzati dal coinvolgimento di numerosi e qualificati stakeholder da una programmazione condivisa dalla costruzione di convergenze programmatiche e alleanze di scopo su obiettivi condivisi dalla formazione rivolta tutti professionisti dei vari settori coinvolti per acquisire competenze linguaggi comuni conoscenze reciproche per definire ruoli compiti e responsabilit di ognuno altro elemento qualificante stato quello di diffondere la cultura degli stili di vita attivi come fonte di benessere personale e collettiva facilitare la pratica motoria e sportiva anche nei soggetti fragili soggetti svantaggiati sul piano socio economico soggetti con disturbi psichici e mentali categorie pi difficili da coinvolgere queste progettualit la promozione dell attivit motoria passa anche attraverso investimenti campo culturale educativo ambientale sociale economico e ci pu contribuire raggiungere gli obiettivi dello sviluppo sostenibile sdg la promozione dell attivit motoria richiede quindi una forte leadership del settore sanitario che deve comunque interagire con altri settori quali l istruzione la cultura lo sport trasporti l urbanistica e l economia l approccio intersettoriale per disincentivare la sedentariet peraltro era stato gi perseguito dal programma guadagnare salute che agiva sia sullo stile di vita individuale sia modificando le condizioni ambientali e sociali per contrastare gli stili di vita scorretti il presente progetto si svolge nell ambito di programmi di reciproca collaborazione di assistenza di carattere tecnico scientifico con partecipazione delle parti regime paritetico nonch attuazione accordo quadro di collaborazione tra universit degli studi di genova e inail direzione regionale liguria il progetto ha durata triennale e prevede tre fasi che comprendono una preliminare analisi della letteratura l indagine di conoscenze e comportamenti degli studenti di area sanitarium per programmare nella fase finale interventi mirati di prevenzione questa specifica popolazione il disegno dello studio nella prima fase del progetto ha la finalit di mappare il fenomeno infortunistico riportato oggi letteratura consolidando le attuali conoscenze relazione ai principali determinati degli infortuni nel contesto sanitario fine di mappare il fenomeno infortunistico negli operatori sanitari stata condotta una revisione della letteratura sulla base di un quesito di ricerca ampio che rimanda una letteratura di natura complessa ed eterogenea lo studio stato condotto utilizzando la cornice metodologica pubblicata nel protocollo dello studio lo studio stato effettuato seguendo le linee guida preferred reporting items systematic reviews meta analysis prisma criteri peco hanno definito l ambito dello studio e nello specifico sono stati inclusi population operatori sanitari e exposure infortuni c comparatordifferenti tipi di operatori sanitari e outcome prevalenza e incidenza degli infortuni e relativi determinanti sono stati applicati limiti temporali selezionando la letteratura compresa tra il e il anche fine di permettere una comparazione diretta dei risultati con dati epidemiologici presenti nelle banche dati inail locali e nazionali gli infortuni riconducibili alla categoria itinere sono stati esclusi dallo studio accordo con la strategia impostata sono stati considerati gli studi effettuatati paesi occidentali conformit alla definizione impostata dalla organisation economic co operation development oecd la qualit degli studi stata valutata utilizzando la checklist effective public health practice project ephpp quality assessment tool quantitative studies fine di valutare l impatto dell influenza stagionale italia stato adottato un duplice approccio da una parte stata condotta una revisione sistematica di letteratura sulle banche dati pubmed wos e embase per identificare gli studi sugli aspetti epidemiologici virologici e relativi burden dell influenza stagionale condotti italia con esclusione dei case report dall altra sono stati consultati dati della sorveglianza epidemiologica e virologica e quelli relativi ai tassi di ospedalizzazione e alla mortalit attraverso la consultazione di influnet epi influnet vir influweb health sistema nazionale di sorveglianza della mortalit giornaliera sismg e monitoraggio dell andamento delle forme gravi e complicate di influenza stagionale dati sono stati sintetizzati con riferimento alle classi di pediatrica adulta e anziana l indagine si svolta due fasi successive nella prima fase un gruppo multidisciplinare di esperti hta agenas e sihta ha redatto il questionario rivolto alle regioni e pa compilato cura di un referente individuato dalle stesse il questionario articolato otto aree di seguito riportate area introduttiva area regolatoria tecnologie e processo di hta caratteristiche dei prodotti di hta realizzati utilizzo dell hta meccanismi di coinvolgimento degli stakeholder area assenza regolamentazione collaborazioni sono stati previsti due percorsi di compilazione differenziati relazione alla situazione normativa materia di hta di ciascuna regione pa l area introduttiva costituisce la sezione iniziale riservata alle caratteristiche identificative del rispondente contenente il quesito che permette di indirizzare l utente nella compilazione dei due differenti percorsi il primo percorso riservato alle regioni pa che non hanno regolamentato materia di hta si compone di due aree con un set minimo di domande area assenza regolamentazione collaborazioni il secondo percorso riservato alle regioni pa che hanno regolamentato materia di hta e si compone delle seguenti aree area regolatoria tecnologie e processo di hta caratteristiche dei prodotti di hta realizzati utilizzo dell hta meccanismi di coinvolgimento degli stakeholder collaborazioni il questionario stato poi trasposto formato web da esperti informatici agenas per renderlo compilabile line fine di garantire una migliore qualit di compilazione delle risposte tutte le domande nella versione line sono state programmate prevedendo una risposta obbligatoria anche negativa l invio del questionario era consentito solo qualora lo stato di compilazione fosse stato pari ovvero compilato tutte le sue parti la versione web definitiva stata testata una fase pilota da due regioni individuate dal gruppo di lavoro l indagine stata avviata con richiesta formale della direzione generale agenas per il tramite della commissione salute della conferenza stato regioni ai direttori generali degli assessorati sanit della nomina formale di un referente esperto di hta per la compilazione del questionario ad ogni referente co individuato sono state trasmesse via e mail le credenziali personalizzate di accesso software username e password e l url questionario agenas per la rilevazione line avvenuta nel periodo giugno settembre nella seconda fase dell indagine stato effettuato un approfondimento qualitativo che si articolato tre linee di attivit l effettuazione di interviste con referenti regionali hta la preparazione di schede monografiche regionali e una raccolta e valutazione di prodotti hta segnalati e inviati dalle regioni e pa l approfondimento avvenuto tramite interviste frontali semistrutturate risposta aperta poich questo metodo qualitativo permette la raccolta di informazioni ed aspetti potenzialmente nuovi e non conosciuti oltre una conoscenza diretta dei referenti e delle realt regionali per le interviste sono stati approfonditi bisogni e criticit relativi hta relazione ai tre momenti fondamentali di questo processo valutativo segnalazione e prioritizzazione impatto coinvolgimento degli stakeholder la caratterizzazione di questi aspetti permette di comprendere se e quanto il sistema di adozione delle tecnologie sia governato attraverso l hta il suo impatto effettivo e il livello di apertura ai vari attori del sistema quale indicatore di trasparenza il percorso preparatorio per le interviste con regionali ha richiesto un prioritario e dettagliato lavoro di analisi delle singole realt regionali sulla base delle informazioni estratte dal questionario sono state quindi elaborate delle schede monografiche per ogni regione e pa basate sulle risposte date questionario compilato nella prima fase dell indagine e nelle quali oltre riportare una serie di informazioni relative alle varie fasi della valutazione delle tecnologie si provveduto aggiornamento della normativa regionale relativa hta infine per avere un quadro chiaro ed esplicito della produzione hta evidenziata anche nella compilazione del questionario line alle regioni e pa stato richiesto di compilare una scheda ad hoc sui documenti hta regionali riportandone titolo argomento tipologia e altre informazioni e inoltre di inviare un documento hta per ogni tipologia mini full etc tra quelli ritenuti migliori obiettivo di questa raccolta stato di valutare modo strutturato la qualit e le caratteristiche dei documenti inviati attraverso l utilizzo di check list validate livello internazionale per la valutazione dei prodotti hta il gdl ristretto della siti comunicazione per la sanit pubblica ha lavorato remoto effettuando una revisione della letteratura scientifica e grigia internazionale e nazionale e valorizzando l expertise presente nel gdl per sintetizzare le evidenze merito alla valutazione di efficacia delle azioni comunicative di sanit pubblica la strategia di ricerca elaborata ha incluso una revisione condotta attraverso medline e google limitando la ricerca ai primo risultati visualizzati utilizzando una combinazione di parole chiave terminus mesh identificate secondo il modello pico comunicazione sulla salute campagna di sanit pubblica valutazione efficacia inoltre stata effettuata una ricerca manuale della bibliografia e della sezione related article per identificare ulteriori studi pertinenti l analisi stata condotta ad agosto selezionando preliminarmente gli articoli dal titolo e abstract e successivamente analizzando il testo completo degli articoli potenzialmente idonei dal nell unit di terapia intensiva neonatale del policlinico di bari stato implementato un programma specifico volto migliorare la conoscenza ambito vaccinale dei genitori di neonati pretermine il programma comprende la somministrazione di vaccini durante la degenza ospedale il counseling vaccinale pre e post dimissione l utilizzo dei social medium per divulgare informazioni relative ai vaccini abbiamo valutato l efficacia di questi interventi analizzando la copertura e la tempestivit di somministrazione delle prime due dosi di vaccino esavalente e tra pazienti nei neonati pretermine inoltre si evidenzia un ritardo importante nelle tempistiche di somministrazione dei vaccini studiati l analisi di regressione lineare non ha mostrato alcuna associazione tra il ritardo e il peso alla nascita e l gestazionale questi risultati evidenziano come nostri interventi siano utili per superare l esitazione vaccinale specialmente nei genitori di bambino pretermine e come l offerta attiva di vaccinazioni durante l ospedalizzazione sia uno strumento utile per migliorare la copertura la coorte dei lavoratori e relativi periodi di attivit sono stati ricostruiti dal comitato ex lavoratori e validati da inps procedure di linkage con

economici e sociali con recupero di risorse utilizzate per una migliore tutela del diritto alla salute si riportano di seguito risultati preliminari relativi alla prima fase del progetto sono stati analizzati studi rispondenti ai criteri di ricerca la popolazione inclusa comprende pi di operatori sanitari e soggetti essi equiparati la tipologia di infortunio pi argomentata nel contesto occidentale riguarda gli infortuni biologici e nello specifico quelli da taglio e da punta principali determinanti associati questa tipologia specifica infortunio comprendono la frequenza e l invasivit delle procedure eseguite da parte degli operatori sanitari unitamente adozione di comportamenti non conformi alle procedure standard e reincappucciamento di aghi e contatto con rifiuti contaminati nonch alla carenza di interventi formativi specifici e assenza di addestramento merito utilizzo dei dispositivi di protezione individuale dpi gli infortuni carico del distretto muscolo scheletrico dovuti movimentazione manuale dei carichi e alla movimentazione dei pazienti ospedalizzati rappresentano un fenomeno largamente studiato e di forte impatto sia terminus di disabilit che di danno alla salute deli operatori sanitari nel contesto occidentale principali determinanti associati questa tipologia infortunio riguardano la turnazione la mancanza di sinergia con colleghi materia di movimentazione dei pazienti ospedalizzati le scarse conoscenze materia utilizzo di ausili minori e maggiori l avanzata rispetto alla medium degli operatori sanitari e l essere riconducibile alla categoria occupazionale infermieristica questi fenomeni correlati fenomeno infortunistico carico del sistema muscolo scheletrico rappresentano oggi una delle maggiori sfide da affrontare per il medico del lavoro moderno parallelo ai rischi tradizionali gli operatori sanitari sono esposti rischi emergenti che possono essere causa infortunio occasione di lavoro tra questi sono stati descritti fenomeni di aggressione verbale e fisica di violenza ed episodi infortunistici riconducibili allo stress lavoro correlato la revisione ha evidenziato come il fenomeno infortunistico per questi rischi professionali si concentri nei reparti di psichiatria e nelle unit operative dedite assistenza condizioni di emergenza urgenza e pronto soccorso il genere femminile risultato essere pi soggetto violenza di tipo verbale mentre il genere maschile risultato essere pi incline subire violenze fisiche aggressioni l assenza di barriere di separazione nei reparti di emergenza urgenza co tituisce un fattore di rischio per questa tipologia infortuni gli anni di anzianit lavorativa rivestano un ruolo significativo relazione fenomeno infortunistico infatti la popolazione di giovani operatori sanitari risultata essere maggior rischio per alcune tipologie infortuni e biologici mentre l anzianit impiego costituisce un determinate infortunio per altre tipologie infortunio e muscolo scheletrici cadute alcune settori espansione riguardanti mansioni impieghi non tradizionali e operatori dediti cure domiciliari e lavoratori precari sono maggior rischio infortuni imputabili allo stress lavoro correlato ritmi di lavoro serrati e alla mancanza di formazione specifica relazione esposizione ai rischi professionali il fenomeno infortunistico negli operatori sanitari nei paesi occidentali e particolar modo nei paesi europei risulta essere sottodimensionato causa del fenomeno di report della scarsa consapevolezza e dall insoddisfacente percezione dei rischi nel contesto occupazionale un campione di studenti ha partecipato allo studio il era di sesso femminile e l mediana era di anni iqr il era fuorisede il sede la prevalenza di sintomi depressivi stata del mentre la prevalenza di ideazione suicidaria del principali fattori di rischio comune per questi due outcome sono risultati essere orientamento sessuale bisessuale asessuale situazione economica insufficiente scarsa situazione peggiorata dal fatto di essere fuorisede per quanto riguarda sintomi depressivi parenti di grado con patologie psichiatriche inoltre fattori di rischio significativi pi collegati frequentare la scuola di medicina sono stati giudicare negativamente aver scelto medicina non essere soddisfatti delle amicizie con compagni di corso considerare il clima con compagni di corso competitivo e ostile essere preoccupati di non essere altezza della professione contrario avere una buona ottima coesione familiare sembrava essere un fattore protettivo per entrambi gli outcome inoltre una significativa maggiore probabilit di mostrare sintomi depressivi stata riportata da studentesse partecipanti che vivevano con il partner coinquilini partecipanti che praticavano sport meno di coloro con una patologia cronica e coloro che ritenevano che la scuola di medicina impedisse specifiche attivit invece avere hobby curiosit intellettuale come motivazione della scelta universitaria e non avere preoccupazioni relativamente futuro accademico lavorativo sembrano ridurre significativamente la probabilit di avere sintomi depressivi avere una relazione e essere di sesso femminile hanno mostrato di diminuire la probabilit di riportare ideazione suicidaria le regressioni non hanno rilevato nessuna differenza significativa tra modelli campione intero e modelli stratificati per anni di corso tuttavia le frequenze dei fattori di rischio e di protezione erano distribuite diversamente negli anni di corso secondo test del chi quadro e anno anche la soddisfazione della propria medium e l essere tempo con gli esami hanno influenzato significativamente la presenza di sintomi depressivi da notare come alcuni fattori di rischio fossero pi frequenti negli studenti fuorisede come praticare sport meno di e pensare che la scuola di medicina impedisca di avere hobby inoltre fuorisede del anno hanno dichiarato pi frequentemente di giudicare negativamente la scelta di medicina inoltre il del campione presentava un basso rischio di stress il un rischio moderato e il un rischio elevato alcuni fattori sono risultati essere significativamente correlati ad un aumentato rischio di stress tutto il campione il genere femminile una sede universitaria situata nel centro nel sud italia una cattiva situazione finanziaria una cattiva opinione della scelta effettuata iscrivendosi medicina ritenere il clima tra compagni di corso competitivo e ostile non sentirsi altezza della professione altri fattori di rischio avevano significativit statistica solo nella sottopopolazione degli studenti non fuorisede ad esempio una storia familiare di suicidio tentativi di suicidio pensare che la scuola di medicina impedisse di riposarsi sufficienza infine alcuni fattori di rischio sono risultati specifici degli studenti fuorisede si tratta della presenza di una patologia cronica il basso impegno sportivo settimanale il non aver stretto amicizie soddisfacenti con compagni di corso pensare che frequentare l universit impedisca avere hobby e dormire adeguatamente essere preoccupati per la scelta della specialit per le limitate opportunit lavorative per quanto riguarda fattori protettivi fattori significativi per l intero campione sono una valutazione ottima del proprio nucleo familiare avere un hobby aver scelto la scuola di medicina per curiosit intellettuale negli studenti sede risulta protettivo aver scelto medicina per opportunit lavorative e per prestigio sociale e ritenere che il futuro sia stimolante non pensare affatto futuro infine specificamente per gli studenti fuorisede fattore protettivo la presenza di una relazione sentimentale dati della sorveglianza epidemiologica ci permettono di stimare che nonostante la variabilit inter stagionale l incidenza cumulativa di sindromi similinfluenzali nella popolazione generale si attesta sul l incidenza mostra valori superiori nella fascia di popolazione di compresa tra e anni e inferiori nei soggetti di anni tassi di ospedalizzazione risultano maggiori negli ultrasettantacinquenni con valori medi di e per rispettivamente tra gli uomini e le donne anche con riferimento alla mortalit sono gli ultrasessantacinquenni far registrare tassi pi alti la letalit dell influenza si attesta su valori elevati nei casi gravi con necessit di ricovero unit di terapia intensiva e ossigenazione extracorporea membrana la revisione sistematica ha messo disposizione un totale di studi di cui sulle complicanze e sulla mortalit due lavori sono stati condotti sulla popolazione pediatrica due sono stati condotti su gruppi selezionati di pazienti adulti rischio quattro sulla popolazione anziana e due su tutta la popolazione con un attenzione specifica alla mortalit dalla sintesi di questi lavori possibile desumere importanti informazioni sebbene non sia possibile trarre delle conclusioni definitive circa le probabilit di sviluppo di complicanze causa dell eterogeneit delle popolazioni e dei setting considerati la prima informazione rilevante riguarda la pi alta probabilit di sviluppare complicanze che si registra nei soggetti anziani e con condizioni rischio cui si raggiungono valori anche pari la seconda riguarda la rilevante probabilit di sviluppo di complicanze fino valori del anche nell pediatrica rappresentate pi comunemente da infezioni del tratto respiratorio inferiore e da otite infine relativamente alla mortalit la letteratura ci permette di imputare influenza un eccesso medio quantificabile decessi per quando vengono considerate influenza e polmonite e per quando si considerano tutte le cause seguito alle azioni di miglioramento partite nel si attesta un trend crescita dell adesione ai test di screening relativamente allo screening dei tumori della cervice uterina nel stata raggiunta un adesione del con un miglioramento del rispetto equivalente test di screening eseguiti pi anno nel l adesione allo screening dei tumori del colon retto stata del rispetto del si mantiene stabile con percentuali attorno l adesione allo screening mammografico per quanto riguarda la progressione corretta delle chiamate allo screening mammografico delle donne tra ed anni infine si verificato un incremento di quasi il passando dal nel nel con il recupero di circa donne mai aderenti che non erano state invitate negli ultimi anni circa risposta questionario per indagare motivi di mancata adesione allo screening del colon retto il afferma di non aver eseguito il test per dimenticanza ed il per pigrizia inoltre solo dei partecipanti ha eseguito il test seguito contatto telefonico di questi il era di sesso femminile e la maggior parte provenivano dal distretto di bologna citt inoltre solo il degli utenti che avevano accettato di ricevere nuovamente l invito ha poi eseguito il test questi anni di attivit si pu stimare che lo screening cardiovascolare abbia permesso l arruolamento di circa soggetti tra visita e follow attualmente risulta che continuare il cardio modo pi strutturato interno di alcune aulss la regione veneto mentre altre regioni lo fanno solo piccole realt locali e quelle che si sono dimostrate interessate per motivi di tipo logisticoamministrativo non sono ancora partite con la chiamata attiva ad oggi il iv screening che si affianca ai tre classici oncologici ha dimostrato di essere accattivante per la popolazione infatti il tasso di adesione che alcune aulss arriva anche medium supera abbondantemente il gli ultimi risultati nelle coorti di nascita dal hanno dimostrato che circa il dei soggetti valutati rientra classe il classe b il classe c il e il rimanente classe per quanto riguarda la misurazione dei parametri quali la glicemia ed ipertensione risulta che meno del iperglicemico e circa il iperteso inoltre il dei soggetti risulta avere un bmi e il fumatore estrema sintesi l indagine ha mostrato come solo una regione su due prevedeva una regolamentazione relativa attivit di valutazione delle tecnologie sanitarie hta nel biennio sono stati prodotti report regionali di hta di cui il dei casi relativo ai dispositivi medici e il ai farmaci nello specifico dalla survey cui hanno aderito regioni su emerso che regioni hanno adottato leggi e regolamenti materia basilicata lazio liguria lombardia piemonte puglia sicilia toscana veneto emilia romagna abruzzo non hanno legiferato valle aosta marche umbria e trento bolzano e calabria pur svolgendo attivit di valutazione delle tecnologie sanitarie infine campania molise friuli venezia giulia e sardegna non hanno risposto questionario l indagine ha inoltre messo evidenza che solo regioni lombardia veneto emilia romagna puglia e sicilia tutte appartenenti gruppo delle realt che hanno regolamentato le attivit di hta hanno adottato disposizioni relative conflitto di interesse mentre riguardo impatto regionale delle valutazioni di hta soltanto veneto risultati dei report erano sempre vincolanti discussione e conclusioni risultati dell indagine conoscitiva evidenziano uno scenario variegato che testimonia lo sviluppo delle attivit di health technology assessment italia seppure forme eterogenee questo patrimonio informativo conforta la scelta del legislatore di istituire una cabina di regia presso il ministero della salute l dicembre per assicurare uniformit nella governance del settore particolare dei dispositivi medici inoltre costituisce la nuova base per un impianto del programma nazionale di hta che tenga conto di quanto realizzato sinora e delle realt pi avanzate e promuova il progresso delle altre ponendo centro l interesse del cittadino quanto paziente e contribuente ad accedere alle tecnologie sanitarie di maggior valore rispetto ai propri bisogni l hta l unica risposta strutturale grado di garantire innovazione e sostenibilit servizio sanitario nazionale assicurando allo stesso tempo equo accesso alle tecnologie sanitarie di valore per cittadini l indagine mostra come molta strada sia stata fatta dalle regioni terminus di produzione di report che c ancora molto da fare terminus di qualit delle valutazioni e per garantire un impatto sistematico degli esiti delle valutazioni stesse sulle decisioni livello regionale e aziendale il nuovo programma nazionale di hta promette di mettere sistema tutte le competenze livello nazionale regionale e aziendale sviluppate questi anni e garantire un reale impatto dell hta sulle decisioni politiche e manageriali nel sistema importante fare presto e renderlo operativo senza indugi allo stato attuale il programma nazionale sta concludendo la sua fase pilota e si auspica possa divenire operativo con primo giorni del prossimo anno tra risultati raggiunti si annovera la progressiva e graduale diffusione della cultura e il crescente interesse sul tema dell hta lombardia consolidata dalla nascita della sezione regionale della societ italiana di hta sihta attraverso il progetto kel attualmente primo ed unico corso di formazione sviluppato per gli stakeholder aziendali sul tema dell hta italia si raggiunta la formazione distanza di persone di cui lombarde da altre regioni particolare piemonte sicilia ed emilia romagna e la formazione sul

cambiamento dei comportamenti r k e conoscenze r k non producono un significativo aumento della self efficacy r k per quanto riguarda nello specifico la valutazione delle azioni comunicative sanit pubblica la letteratura propone una serie di principi framework e linee guida tra quali nella scelta degli indicatori di efficacia ed efficienza per la valutazione delle campagne di comunicazione sanit pubblica la letteratura suggerisce di essere chiari su ci che viene valutato realistici ed espliciti sugli effetti diretti e indiretti previsti considerando anche potenziali effetti indesiderati questo senso appare utile riportare alcuni dei consigli pratici presenti nell allegato evaluate della guida ecdc vaccine safety events managing communication response gli autori ricordano come sia importante monitorare e valutare la comunicazione sia durante che dopo un evento vaccino collegato vre fine di adattare la strategia comunicativa alle diverse circostanze affinando le azioni alle esigenze future durante le prime ore dall annuncio di un vre essenziale tenere attivamente sotto controllo mezzi di comunicazione per valutare la necessit di una variazione nelle tattiche di comunicazione fine ad esempio di mitigare le preoccupazioni della popolazione oppure di assicurare che medium diffondano adeguatamente messaggi chiave che si ritiene essenziale veicolare quando l evento risolto fondamentale chiudere il cerchio informando gli alti dirigenti modo da prepararli qualora siano chiamati ad esprimere un parere fornire informazioni inoltre utile pubblicare rilasciare una dichiarazione cui sia sintetizzata la conclusione della ricerca fatta sull evento avverso per rafforzare la fiducia con il pubblico e partner coinvolti inoltre fondamentale documentare le lezioni apprese riassumendo le strategie e tattiche comunicative efficaci e l impatto dell evento sul programma di vaccinazione per modulare la strategia comunicativa globale e rafforzare la risposta agli eventi futuri tra criteri pratici di valutazione semplici realistici credibili e sintetici la guida suggerisce di raccogliere ritagli di giornale e la copertura radiotelevisiva per misurare la risposta alla chiamata azione valutando l impatto terminus di numero di articoli spot radiofonici televisivi notizie citazioni contenenti le proprie informazioni rilievo posizione sul giornale momento di trasmissione relazione ai picchi di ascolto e successo dei motti correttezza del messaggio rapporti positivi con influencer ad esempio un giornalista di rilievo con cui rafforzare legami risposta del pubblico valutare tramite un semplice questionario anche solamente ottenere un impressione informale e approssimativa se le persone strada hanno ascoltato il messaggio tramite quale mezzo di comunicazione e se lo hanno compreso la guida suggerisce anche una check list per una rapida valutazione della propria campagna comunicativa che prevede semplici domande sono soddisfatto della risposta ho bisogno di cambiare il messaggio ho bisogno di migliorare il modo cui trasmetto il messaggio quale mezzo di comunicazione ha riportato la storia dovrei utilizzare altre modalit di feedback ad esempio gruppi di discussione questionari quante domande sono state rivolte organizzazione come risultato del mio lavoro sulla comunicazione tra limiti evidenziabili letteratura agli studi che riguardano la valutazione dell efficacia delle azioni comunicative per la salute pubblica ci sono la debolezza dei disegni di studio la limitatezza del campione il setting di studio la maggior parte degli studi che aggiornano questa revisione sono condotti paesi via di sviluppo la mancanza di controllo di gruppi di confronto di basi teoriche il sottoutilizzo della valutazione di processo l utilizzo di obiettivi di valutazione e misure di risultato che non corrispondono ai reali obiettivi della campagna e per contro la mancanza di riferimenti per valutare potenziali effetti indesiderati delle azioni comunicative su la ricerca ha prodotto un totale iniziale di citazioni termine del processo di selezione articoli pubblicati tra il e il sono stati inclusi nella sintesi finale la dimensione campionaria degli studi varia considerevolmente da individui la maggior parte degli studi stata condotta negli stati uniti e con un disegno di studio sperimentale gli outcome valutati includono la copertura per prima dose vaccinale il completamento delle dosi previste e il numero di dosi somministrate le strategie valutate prevedono l invio di remind interventi di informazione

maggior parte degli studi riportava interventi multipli tre diverse aree migliorare l accesso alla vaccinazione eliminare le barriere individuali introdurre interventi di politica sanitarium diretti imporre la vaccinazione negli os sei studi sono risultati di qualit forte quattro moderata e debole gli interventi basati sul sistema sanitario variano notevolmente nei vari paesi e nelle diverse tipologie di rsa ed difficile stabilire quali interventi sono pi utili il nostro studio suggerisce che migliori risultati nell adesione alla vaccinazione negli os sono ottenuti combinando pi interventi diverse aree effetti le campagne educative e vaccine day sono una strategia efficace per aumentare la cv tra gli os delle rsa specialmente quando coinvolgono infermieri preparati e dopo aver analizzato specifiche barriere le principali motivazioni per la mancanza di adesione vaccino sono idee sbagliate carenza di conoscenza e mancanza di un comodo accesso vaccino l intervento singolo pi rilevante risulta l introduzione di una politica di vaccinazione obbligatoria per gli os sono stati arruolati operatori sanitari le ospedalizzazioni nei bambino di anno hanno rappresentato il del

utilizzo eccessivo di antibiotici nell ambito dell assistenza primaria nell ambito ospedaliero e nell ambito veterinario era causa di antibiotico resistenza il modello di regressione logistica multivariata ha mostrato che questa conoscenza era significativamente pi frequente tra farmacisti di genere maschile tra coloro che lavoravano un numero maggiore di ore settimana e tra coloro che ricevevano informazioni da riviste scientifiche e da internet dai mass medium pi della met dei farmacisti intervistati riteneva importante il ruolo dei farmacisti negli interventi educativi sulla

percorso e sui professionisti coinvolti tutti professionisti hanno lamentato la mancanza del punto di vista del paziente da gennaio marzo sono pervenute spp notifiche di infortunio rispettivamente studenti e dipendenti avvenute durante la pratica chirurgica uso reincappucciamento dell ago e operazioni di pulizia dai questionari risultato che persone su intervistate nella attivit lavorativa hanno subito un infortunio da punture e tagli accidentali solo nell ultimo anno medici odontoiatri anni di anzianit di servizio risultano maggiormente soggetti agli infortuni seguiti dagli studenti odontoiatria gli infortuni con ago dito e per movimento incontrollato del paziente sono pi frequenti particolarmente durante interventi di odontoiatria conservativa e chirurgici dichiarano di aver effettuato la notifica mentre ammettono di non averlo fatto giustificando che il paziente non era sieropositivo che non avevano tempo che non conoscono la procedura aziendale rispondono di conoscere l

che hanno deciso volontariamente di partecipare stato distribuito un questionario auto compilato composto da una sezione socio demografica sviluppata seguito ad una revisione della letteratura per includere la maggior parte dei fattori associati benessere mentale degli studenti di medicina e una sezione relativa alla salute mentale la stima della prevalenza di sintomi depressivi stata realizzata con il beck depression inventory ii bdi ii uno strumento di item ogni item ha un punteggio da e la somma di tutti punteggi costituisce lo score finale punteggi da rappresentano nessuna minimum depressione leggera moderata e grave stato quindi utilizzato un cut di per definire la presenza di sintomi depressivi primo outcome del presente studio l item del bdi ii riguarda l ideazione suicidaria particolare si deciso di considerare l opzione non ho alcun pensiero suicida come assenza di ideazione suicidaria e raggruppare le rimanenti tre opzioni come presenza di ideazione suicidaria rendendo anche questo outcome dicotomico la valutazione dello stress percepito stata effettuata con la perceived stress scale versione da item frequentemente utilizzata e gi validata su campioni di studenti universitari gli item della analizzano quanto l individuo abbia subito eventi imprevedibili e quanto sia stato grado di farvi fronte modo funzionale nel mese precedente ogni item una scala likert da alcuni hanno significato e quindi score invertito lo score totale varia dunque da identificando categorie di rischio per stress percepito ultimo outcome considerato basso medio alto il test del chi quadro e l analisi dei residui standardizzati sono stati utilizzati per valutare la differenza di prevalenza delle variabili tra gli studenti con senza sintomi depressivi gli studenti con senza ideazione suicidaria gruppi di rischio individuati dalla pss gli effetti delle variabili indipendenti sulla presenza di sintomi depressivi sono stati analizzati tramite modelli di regressione logistica multivariata aggiustati per e genere sia campione intero sia stratificando per anni la selezione delle variabili da inserire nel modello avvenuta tramite un metodo backward stepwise analisi analoghe sono state realizzate per valutare predittori della presenza di ideazione suicidaria stata poi effettuata una regressione multinomiale rif basso rischio di stress con metodo

sistematica nella analisi e interpretazione dei dati sanitari essenziali per pianificare implementare e valutare delle azioni di sanit pubblica garantire un efficace ed adeguato controllo delle malattie infettive tal fini sistemi di sorveglianza devono avere la capacit di raccogliere ed integrare dati necessari attingendo pi fonti molte fonti di dati si sono sviluppate nel tempo registri cause di morte registri di patologie banche dati di attivit di laboratorio schede di dimissione ospedaliera risultati di indagini epidemiologiche specifiche dati ambientali dati di tipo socioeconomico eccetera eccetera ugualmente si sono evolute nel tempo le tecnologie forme e modalit di conservazione dei dati creando opportunit per l utilizzo di un grande quantit di dati non sanitari comunque potenzialmente utili nell attivit di indagine epidemiologica sulle malattie infettive sarebbe utile di disporre di una piattaforma informatica unica nazionale supporto delle attivit di sorveglianza delle singole asl e regioni attualmente frammentate nell utilizzo di soluzioni informatiche individuali spesso indagate comunque obsolete ugualmente sarebbe auspicabile disposare di sistemi

quantitativi e qualitativi dei servizi che svolgono queste attivit che spesso operano situazioni di forte carenza anche nella prospettiva di lavorare sulla preparedness fronte delle possibili emergenze infettive che richiedono organizzazioni flessibili e resilienti un inversione nel trend delle emissioni di gas serra l aumento delle temperature globali si tradurr con elevata probabilit nei prossimi decenni una modifica delle condizioni meteorologiche maggiore frequenza e intensit di eventi estremi dalle alluvioni improvvise periodi siccitosi aumento della temperatura con il verificarsi di ondate di calore sempre pi violente e innalzamento del livello del mare sono primo possibili effetti tali eventi catastrofici graveranno soprattutto sulle citt spesso situate lungo la costa nelle pianure alluvionali lungo spaccature sismiche con la loro concentrazione di beni e persone sono vulnerabili alle catastrofi particolare tre quarti di tutte le grandi citt si trovano sulla costa e pi della met della popolazione mondiale vive entro chilometri dal mare un altro aspetto che pesa negativamente tal senso il fenomeno della forte urbanizzazione che ha caratterizzato gli ultimi decenni entro il le nazioni unite stimano che pi del della popolazione mondiale andr vivere nelle aree urbane asia orientale la popolazione urbana dovrebbe raddoppiare tra il e il l urbanizzazione rapida e non pianificata che avviene su terreni marginali e aree pericolose combinazione con insediamenti mal costruiti ed ecosistemi degradati mette pericolo pi persone e pi beni e particolarmente rischio sono le citt piccole e medie rapida crescita spesso non solo mancano di risorse finanziarie infrastrutture e servizi anche la capacit di gestire la popolazione urbana via via aumento dietro questo obiettivo c l esigenza di conoscere lo stato di salute di una comunit di definirne bisogni sia percepiti che non di sorvegliare e di monitorare abitudini e comportamenti di realizzare mappe delle fragilit e di individuare aree cui si concentrano le disuguaglianze che come noto sono alla base di un sottoutilizzo peggio ancora di un utilizzo inappropriato delle risorse offerte quel territorio ci nella consapevolezza che esiste un effetto area di residenza come ben descritto bibliografia l approccio questo caso non pu che partire dalla realizzazione di un profilo di salute che attraverso dati raccolti da varie fonti demografiche amministrative sanitarie sociali permette di riconoscere differenze territoriali e quindi individua bisogni oggettivi fianco risulta fondamentale conoscere la comunit locale per meglio caratterizzare quei bisogni che sono percepiti come rilevanti di l della loro oggettiva importanza terminus di riconosciuti fattori di rischio di frequenza dei fenomeni e di consistenza delle evidenze scientifiche sotto questo punto di vista diventa fondamentale avere competenze nella raccolta ed analisi di informazioni di natura qualitativa attraverso un coinvolgimento attivo della comunit locale che si va studiare e su cui si intende poi agire con specifici interventi da ultimo e certamente non ultimo terminus di importanza avere la capacit di definire determinanti di salute che agiscono quella popolazione e mappare la distribuzione delle disuguaglianze sostanzialmente condizionate proprio da quei determinanti di salute necessario tutti questi step avere disposizione esperienze nella gestione di mappe che contestualizzano bene la distribuzione dei fenomeni indagati e forniscono modo immediato suggerimenti sulla priorit degli interventi e quindi sul buon esito degli stessi quanto realizzati modo mirato si tratta di un percorso complesso che necessita di un lavoro multidisciplinare e multiprofessionale che ha comunque il grande vantaggio di leggere tutto tondo fenomeni socio economici che gran parte sono alla base di quanto osservato localmente un percorso complesso non impossibile come dimostrano varie esperienze livello nazionale vedi lavori del prof giuseppe costa e internazionale che vede michael marmot un riferimento fondamentale che va tuttavia ancora meglio testato nella sua applicabilit e nel livello di efficacia ottenuto rispetto agli esiti di salute perseguiti un esempio carattere locale quello realizzato dall azienda usl di bologna che ha prodotto profili di salute e di comunit oggi orientati sostenere profili di diseguaglianze da offrire ai decisori locali ed alla comunit tutta per l esecuzione attualmente corso di interventi mirati contrastare quei determinanti di svantaggio sociale che sono la pi importante causa di disuguaglianze di salute questo modo stato possibile rilevare differenze importanti interno della citt di bologna dove ad esempio sono state osservate aree territoriali con differenze di aspettativa di vita di oltre anni e mezzo sia tra maschi che tra le femmine questo lavoro ha avviato un processo di pianificazione di interventi socio sanitari con il comune di bologna che ha gi individuato due aree su cui svolgere attivit che contrastino le condizioni di natura demografica sociale ed economica che poi sono causa di differenze salute nella popolazione particolare stato avviato nell aprile del il progetto piazza dei colori presso l area croce del biacco che vede la presenza costante quel territorio di un assistente sociale ed un operatore sanitario che hanno l obiettivo di costruire relazioni improntate alla fiducia con cittadini residenti fine di comprenderne pi direttamente bisogni e quindi orientarne il percorso di accesso ai servizi socio sanitari disponibili analogo intervento ovviamente rimodulato funzione delle peculiarit del contesto specifico gi essere da alcuni anni presso l area pescarola ragione di questi interventi per arricchire la conoscenza dei bisogni e per definire meglio le cause alla base delle disuguaglianze salute osservate stata finanziata dall universit di bologna dall azienda usl dall azienda ospedaliera sant orsola malpighi e dal comune di bologna una ricerca di natura antropologica che potr fornire molte indicazioni per orientare meglio gli interventi di sostegno socio sanitario futuri da organizzare nei sei quartieri che compongono la citt di bologna nel contempo stata realizzata un interessante esperienza un area periferica dell azienda usl di bologna il comune di molinella la comunit di questo territorio ha voluto costruire un profilo di comunit partire dalla scuola e nella scuola sviluppato attraverso il coinvolgimento oltre che degli studenti anche del personale docente e dei genitori tramite una convenzione specifica con il dipartimento di sanit pubblica dell azienda usl di bologna il dirigente dell istituto comprensivo scolastico ha coordinato la costruzione del profilo coinvolgendo l intera comunit partire ovviamente dall amministrazione comunale il profilo ha permesso di orientare gli interventi di educazione alla salute offerti agli studenti partire dalle scuole materne fino alle scuole medie inferiori coerenza con quanto indicato dal piano regionale della prevenzione la comunit tutta stata poi esposta ad una valutazione della qualit di vita percepita utilizzando il questionario validato nella sua traduzione italiano risultati ottenuti permettono di avere un punto di riferimento per l analisi di efficacia di interventi di comunit che si stanno progettando tutte queste attivit necessitano del contributo dell epidemiologia che deve assumere il compito di garantire sistemi di sorveglianza adeguati che permettano di analizzare e valutare l efficacia degli interventi e se necessario riorientarli anche un ottica di ottimizzazione delle risorse disponibili e perch no anzi sarebbe auspicabile anche di sostegno richieste di specifici investimenti di promozione della salute alla luce di bisogni specifici e di validata efficacia degli interventi messi campo il termine hard reach trova differenti accezioni che vanno dal campo del marketing sociale quello della ricerca scientifica con sfumature sempre meno omogenee complessivamente si pu parlare di hard reach riferimento individui gruppi che causa di barriere di salute geografiche culturali linguistiche attitudinali sociali lavorative od economiche sono caratterizzati da un ridotto accesso ai servizi anche sanitari e da uno stato di salute generalmente peggiore rispetto quello della restante popolazione talus gruppi generalmente rappresentano una sfida per la sanit pubblica terminus di inclusione e presa carico ottemperanza alle direttive della regione lazio

presa carico e di orientamento ai servizi alla costruzione di un modello organizzativo di intervento comunitario integrato sociosanitario che tenesse conto della costoefficacia e che potesse renderlo replicabile e perfettibile altri contesti di alta vulnerabilit dall osservazione azione flussi routinari sorveglianza e registri per programmare la prevenzione oncologica italia con questo tipo di indicatori siamo grado di monitorare la qualit del processo che viene effettuata sia nel confronto con gli standard sia una logica di benchmarking siamo grado cio di identificare le situazioni outlier bene e male nel confronto fra regioni e interno della regione questo flusso informativo subisce degli stringenti controlli logico formali ed epidemiologici la survey viene analizzata da parte dell osservatorio nazionale screening ons sia livello regionale sia quantitativamente che qualitativamente r questa nuova forma ritorna alle singole regioni alcuni casi tasso dei cancri di intervallo tasso di stadi precoci allo round successivo ecc siamo grado di creare degli indicatori precoci indicatori surrogato dell impatto se per vogliamo misurare l impatto dello screening sulla popolazione bersaglio non possiamo limitarci alla popolazione che si sottopone test dobbiamo verificare l impatto sull intera popolazione target che dovrebbe essere stata tutta invitata allo screening per fare questo necessaria un altra fonti informativa esterna flusso screening che sono vari flussi correnti schede di dimissioni ospedaliere flussi di anatomia patologica certificati di morte soprattutto il registro tumori per questo si creato nel tempo un lavoro comune fra ons e associazione dei registri tumore airtum realt l interesse era reciproco quanto almeno per le patologie oggetto di programma di screening non possibile comprendere l impatto senza l ausilio del registro tumori contempo non possibile spiegare gli andamenti epidemiologici di alcune sedi tumorali senza prendere considerazione l attivit dei programmi di screening altre parole ogni valutazione dell andamento di una patologia oncologica deve tener conto dei mutamenti dell attivit diagnostica dalla sua capacit di anticipazione e della sua frequenza ogni confronto fra due gruppi aree dovrebbe essere standardizzato per attivit diagnostica questo punto utile introdurre alcune note di metodo nel mondo clinico vale il paradigma che la prova cruciale per valutare l evidenza di efficacia nel caso degli screening oncologici la riduzione dell incidenza e della mortalit causa specifica sia il trial clinico randomizzato nel campo dei programmi di screening trial randomizzati le tecniche di quasi randomization sono sempre il metodo migliore per studiare l impatto di una nuova procedura diagnostica studi osservazionali ben condotti possono aggiungere informazioni fondamentali io credo che trial randomizzati rimangono un metodo decisivo per studiare l effetto sulla storia biologica della malattia quando si vogliono studiare gli effetti su popolazioni reali alcune variabili di contesto non randomizzabili assumono una importanza fondamentale prendiamo per esempio la partecipazione un programma di screening questa dipender anche da alcuni fattori circostanziali l informazione generalista l atteggiamento della comunit sanitarium etc fattori che non possono essere randomizzati un trial randomizzato per le sue rigide procedure crea un mondo un po segregato invece un programma di sanit pubblica per la sua riuscita ha bisogno di poter sviluppare tutte le possibili interazioni un approccio valutativo di tipo osservazionale ha bisogno di individuare la migliore popolazione confrontabile non essendo possibile la randomizzazione si possono ipotizzare questi confronti confronto prima dell intervento v dopo l intervento nella stessa popolazione confronto fra aree geografiche simili variabili rispetto intensit dell intervento confronto fra popolazioni partecipanti e popolazioni non partecipanti programma di screening ovviamente questi confronti pongono dei problemi di possibili distorsioni tipo problemi di comparabilit temporali problemi di comparabilit di popolazioni problemi di comparabilit geografica questa collaborazione fra ons e airtum ha dato luogo una vasta produzione scientifica di valutazione dell impatto degli screening sulla popolazione elegibile italia ricorderemo solo alcune delle pubblicazioni dividendole per tipologia di screening nel campo dello screening mammografico stata valutata riduzione incidenza tassi cancri avanzati riduzione di mortalit specifica l diagnosi indotta dal programma di screening di particolare interesse sono state le valutazioni condotte veneto dove lo screening era partito diversi periodi temporali tal modo si potuto valutare anche l effetto migliorativo dei programmi organizzati rispetto aree dove l attivit precoce spontanea era molto diffusa e svolta centri di alta specializzazione nel campo dello screening colorettale stata valutata diminuzione degli stadi avanzati diminuzione della mortalit diminuzione dell incidenza la valutazione dell impatto degli screening cervicali si rilevata particolarmente complessa quanto bisognava valutare cosa aggiunge un programma organizzato rispetto una pratica spontanea diffusa da molti anni con complessi metodi statistici che hanno studiato lag temporali fra inizio del programma e andamento dell incidenza siamo riusciti evidenziare come programmi organizzati sono risusciti ad accentuare il trend discendente di incidenza del cervico carcinoma conclusione l esperienza della valutazione dei programmi di screening ha evidenziato necessit di tenere considerazione l attivit diagnostica per la valutazione dell occorrenza della patologia oncologica importante la valutazione di impatto dei programmi di sanit pubblica assicurare che cittadini siano sani e raggiungano il loro pieno potenziale presuppone la prevenzione delle malattie e dei traumi la promozione della salute e del benessere la capacit di garantire condizioni di vita che favoriscano le scelte salutari la capacit di comunicare tempestivamente la capacit di fornire le prestazioni correlate questi obiettivi maniera efficace e coordinata una pubblicazione marshall e ovretveit affermano che l integrazione tra le articolazioni di una azienda sanitarium cure primarie dipartimento di prevenzione ospedale ormai un elemento irrinunciabile per il sistema sanitario soprattutto nel tentativo di garantire assistenza di qualit contenendo costi l integrazione fra le articolazioni del sistema sanitario potrebbe migliorarne la capacit di svolgere la loro missione e di relazionarsi agli altri stakeholder per catalizzare la collaborazione favorendo un movimento intersettoriale verso il miglioramento della salute della popolazione gli autori identificano alcuni elementi critici capaci di ostacolare il processo di integrazione fra gli effettori del sistema assistenziale separazione delle strutture operative conseguente separazione delle responsabilit e degli obiettivi da conseguire disomogeneit negli approcci culturali dei professionisti piani di intervento paralleli con pochi punti di contatto e con scarsa convergenza assenza di strategie per aumentare le competenze che professionisti nei diversi ambiti professionali dovrebbero avere comune per valorizzare la loro complementariet una valutazione condotta da lydia lebrun e coll vengono indicati come bisogni specifici per favorire l integrazione tra cure primarie e sanit pubblica investire risorse per collaborare e per affrontare determinanti sociali di salute esercitare una forte leadership per premiare le collaborazioni creare fiducia tra partner con chiare attese e chiare responsabilit allineamento e standardizzazione della raccolta analisi e scambio di dati secondo questi principi il dipartimento di prevenzione di trento ha interpretato il proprio ruolo di coordinamento garantendo ai tre percorsi di screening oncologico la definizione di standard di riferimento per segmenti di percorso e strumenti per la misurazione e il reporting un contesto di responsabili e referenti ben identificati per segmenti dei tre livelli della prevenzione secondaria oncologica il contesto della provincia autonoma di trento fino inizio del vedeva una responsabilit sui tre percorsi della sola componente clinica anatomia patologica per il tumore collo dell utero gastroenterologia per il tumore del colon retto e radiologia senologica per il tumore della mammella il dipartimento di prevenzione tutt pi aveva il ruolo di garanzia sul solo primo livello limitandosi convocare tre tavoli tecnici per ogni percorso di screening senza agire sul processo di condivisione degli obiettivi e di allineamento processo di budget aziendale dopo un percorso iniziato nel marzo del attualmente tre percorsi di screening hanno un responsabile clinico per il percorso e un responsabile per il coordinamento identificato nel dipartimento di prevenzione il coordinamento screening collaborazione con il responsabile clinico e con referenti per ciascun segmento dei tre livelli degli screening ha il compito di garantire standard minimi tarare il programma sulla velocit del segmento pi fragile garantire standardizzazione misurazione reporting garantire la trasparenza pubblicare le attivit e risultati raggiunti coinvolgere diffusamente professionisti operatori utenti pazienti ecc generare cooperazione e mutuo supporto interno del percorso agire collaborazione tra programmi agevolare reti di esperti confrontare le performance con il contesto nazionale e internazionale ogni percorso di screening dotato di un comitato tecnico scientifico con una rappresentanza di professionisti per ciascuno dei tre segmenti un referente informatico e un referente epidemiologo il ruolo del comitato quello di identificare gli scostamenti tra la performance osservata ciascun livello e il livello atteso secondo quanto stabilito dall osservatorio nazionale screening dalle tre societ scientifiche di riferimento giscor gisma e gisci e basandosi sulle evidenzi scientifiche disponibili e sull analisi del contesto di riferimento proporre azioni sostenibili per il raggiungimento dell obiettivo di riduzione del gap tra osservato e atteso fabbisogni e le proposte emersi dai tre comitati vengono discussi annualmente interno di un comitato interscreening presieduto dalla direzione sanitaria gli obiettivi di miglioramento proposti nel comitato interscreening se giudicati congruenti con gli obiettivi aziendali si traducono nelle schede di budget per le singole unit operative servizi che costituiscono il percorso di screening individuare le priorit valutative di interesse nazionale coerenza con le linee guida europee promuovere e coordinare attivit di valutazione coerenti e non sovrapposte validare indirizzi metodologici condivisi tra tutti gli attori promuovere l utilizzo e la diffusione delle valutazioni verificando che ne derivino comportamenti virtuoso nelle politiche di investimento e disinvestimento la costruzione del programma nazionale di hta e la stessa attivit della cabina di regia ha beneficiato di una attenta analisi dell attivit di hta svolta nelle regioni italiane pre programma nazionale questa analisi stata svolta da agenas nel periodo collaborazione con la societ italiana di health technology assessment nel corso del primo semestre stata avviata una collaborazione tra agenas e sihta societ italiana di health technology assessment finalizzata monitoraggio delle attivit di hta esistenti italia tale ambito agenas e sihta hanno definito un protocollo di ricerca cui sono state pianificate le fasi e le modalit di conduzione dell indagine conoscitiva l indagine conoscitiva ha avuto come obiettivo la raccolta di informazioni sulla diffusione dell hta nelle regioni e province autonome pa italiane e si articolata due fasi la prima fase svolta nel si basata sulla compilazione di un questionario line da parte dei referenti regionali indicati dalle regioni e pa e sulla raccolta di una serie di informazioni standardizzate la seconda fase stata effettuata nel ed consistita un esame dei singoli casi regionali dei bisogni delle criticit espressi da regioni e pa ambiti di particolare interesse emersi dalla prima fase dell indagine e infine una valutazione dei documenti hta prodotti e della qualit di un campione di essi si articola quindi tre output principali schede monografiche per ognuna delle regioni e pa basate sulle risposte date questionario e aggiornamento della normativa relativa hta interviste semistrutturate e frontali con referenti regionali hta raccolta e valutazione dei prodotti affrontare le disuguaglianze nella comunicazione ovvero riconoscere e gestire le differenze riguardo modo cui un messaggio viene ricevuto elaborato e attuato causa delle diverse caratteristiche demografiche socioeconomiche e culturali della popolazione colpita dall emergenza queste disuguaglianze possono comportare alterazioni nel livello di percezione del rischio e nell acquisizione di conoscenze durante le fasi pi critiche dell emergenza influenzando potenzialmente il rispetto dei comportamenti raccomandati e di conseguenza gli esiti di salute sugli individui il sistema deve essere pertanto preparato ad utilizzare contenuti appropriati linguaggi semplici e canali di comunicazione affidabili tra gruppi di popolazione predisponendo strategie per superare le barriere linguistiche culturali e sociali quando necessario utilizzare l ascolto dinamico raccogliere attivamente informazioni attendibili e gestire le voci e le notizie non confermate si tratta di sapere preparare e diffondere messaggi affidabili collaborando con pi realt e utilizzando canali e messaggistica appropriati come sottolineato nel logic model la comunicazione un processo due vie costituito da un lato da annunci alla popolazione dall altro dal monitoraggio delle informazioni diffuse dai medium tradizionali dai social medium e altri canali e dalla valutazione su come queste vengono recepite l ascolto dinamico pertanto quell insieme di processi relativi alla comprensione delle reazioni e delle preoccupazioni della popolazione essenziali per adattare messaggi funzione delle necessit specifiche durante la pandemia di del ad esempio gli stati membri hanno compreso che la popolazione oltre che per possibili effetti della malattia era preoccupata per le scorte insufficienti di antivirali e vaccini ci ha portato responsabili della sanit pubblica diffondere rassicurazioni sulla disponibilit delle forniture comunicare il rischio modo accurato trasparente e tempestivo tenendo conto dell incertezza e delle percezioni del rischio delle popolazioni per riuscirvi necessario trovare un compromesso tra accuratezza e tempestivit coloro che hanno un ruolo attivo nella gestione delle emergenze spesso sentono l esigenza di rispondere rapidamente ai timori della popolazione per evitare che si crei panico e confusione ci avviene soprattutto situazioni cui la preoccupazione pubblica elevata il rischio effettivo basso come accaduto negli stati uniti e europa durante l epidemia di ebola tuttavia comunicare troppo rapidamente assenza di informazioni complete pu creare confusione nella popolazione un secondo momento se il messaggio originale deve essere successivamente adattato causa della modifica dello scenario emergenziale occorre dunque evitare ritardi nel rilascio di informazioni contempo bisogna saper riconoscere le area di incertezza limitandosi fornire notizie verificate e basso grado di variabilit caso contrario potrebbe verificarsi una repentina perdita di credibilit nei confronti delle istituzioni con un conseguente aumento di complessit nelle operazioni di risposta promuovere e mantenere la fiducia inviando con regolarit messaggi che mettano evidenza l affidabilit nel modo cui responsabili dei servizi gestiscono l emergenza si tratta di una funzione strategica tanto che diverse evidenze hanno dimostrato come alti livelli di fiducia nel governo siano stati associate ad un maggiore rispetto dei comportamenti raccomandati come osservato nei paesi bassi durante la pandemia di oltre ad identificare le fonti di informazione ritenute affidabili dal pubblico medium funzionari pubblici leader della comunit alti livelli di fiducia possono essere costruiti nelle fasi inter emergenziali fornendo informazioni sui ruoli e le responsabilit delle varie organizzazioni coinvolte nelle risposte gli aspetti essenziali della erc identificati dalle capability dal logic model coincidono seppur con una diversa organizzazione con quelli presenti nelle guideline della pubblicati nel queste ultime pongono un accento specifico sulla necessit di coinvolgere il numero maggiore possibile di stakeholder sia per costruire appositi piani di comunicazione fase pre emergenziale sia per identificare nelle prime fasi delle emergenze le figure di cui la comunit locali possono fidarsi modo da costruire relazioni con loro e coinvolgerli nel processo decisionale per garantire che gli interventi siano collaborativi e contestualmente appropriati un contesto sociale sempre pi connesso la capacit comunicativa di un sistema costituisce ultima analisi un elemento di importanza pari alle sue risorse strutturali gli attori coinvolti nelle emergenze devono essere consapevoli dell importanza di una comunicazione regolare chiara e affidabile che tenga considerazione le esigenze della popolazione e le barriere che possono presentarsi nei prossimi anni sar fondamentale insegnare competenze di base ambito di erc ai professionisti della salute modo che livello locale nazionale e internazionale si consolidino pratiche standardizzate e condivise capaci di mettere sistemi impegnati nella phep nelle condizioni di rispondere con efficienza ed efficacia alle principali emergenze per la salute pubblica l uso sempre pi crescente dei mass medium come televisione radio anche e soprattutto del web hanno permesso una enorme disponibilit di notizie e contenuti anche di carattere sanitario da condividere e con quali tempistiche quest ultimo aspetto risulta fondamentale caso di emergenze sanitarie il contenuto del messaggio infatti il centro del processo comunicativo e deve essere ampiamente studiato e pianificato affinch risponda ai bisogni informativi dell utente oltre possedere una forma grafica accattivante relativamente alla forma grafica un aspetto importante l utilizzo del logo dell organizzazione che permette il riconoscimento dell istituzione questo permetterebbe sia di promuovere una identificazione dell organizzazione sia di aumentare la fiducia che il cittadino ripone nel contenuto informativo migliorando di conseguenza la credibilit della fonte tuttavia secondo un revisione della letteratura l utilizzo del logo istituzionale nell ambito delle malattie infettive sembrerebbe avere poco impatto inoltre le informazioni devono poter essere reperite modo intuitivo scegliendo il canale social che pi si adatta rispetto tipo di mittente cui il messaggio indirizzato sfruttare eventi mediatici come ad esempio la immunization week un altro aspetto importante che come precedenti richiede pianificazione oltre che dei contenuti anche delle tempistiche da rispettare aggiunta subito prima nel momento cui si intraprende una campagna comunicativa necessario rendere partecipi tutti componenti dell organizzazione circa obiettivi e policy fine di aumentare la partecipazione e raggiungere un ampia adesione non meno importante infine la valutazione e la misurazione dei risultati raggiunti che permette un confronto con gli obiettivi prefissati inoltre la valutazione continuum aiuta identificare ci che dovrebbe essere migliorato e ci che ha riscontrato maggiore successo conclusione la strategia comunicativa attraverso l utilizzo dei social medium deve rientrare nel contesto di una strategia comunicativa pi ampia della quale dovr far parte la comunicazione aziendale l analisi dei rischi la pianificazione e l implementazione delle risposte alle emergenze infatti la comunicazione ambito sanitario un processo trasversale che pu essere considerato una vera lev strategica disposizione del management tal proposito da considerare che la comunicazione agisce su molteplici livelli direttamente sugli utenti tra operatori su altre istituzioni locali e non promuovendo la realizzazione di sinergie inter istituzionali divenendo co il centro dell agire amministrativo e strumento di governo della complessit sociale e organizzativa pur riconoscendo gli indubbi vantaggi che lo sviluppo di internet ha addotto intera societ la larga e rapida diffusione insieme facile e incontrollato accesso ha determinato anche un grave e importante rischio di disinformazione ambito sanitario una delle tematiche che probabilmente pi hanno risentito di tale negativo effetto sono state le vaccinazioni con il movimento no vax sviluppatosi prevalentemente nel web tuttavia il web stato per lungo tempo uno strumento poco per niente utilizzato dalle organizzazioni sanitarie dalle istituzioni pubbliche concorrendo co alla diffusione di informazioni incomplete volutamente scorrette contrario il web ed particolar modo social medium grazie ampia diffusione e largo utilizzo da parte della cittadinanza si pensi che il solo facebook registra miliardi di utenti attivi possono e sempre pi dovrebbero rappresentare un valido strumento di comunicazione e di contrasto alla disinformazione da parte delle organizzazioni sanitarie queste ultime infatti dovrebbero utilizzare mezzi di comunicazione line per gestire sviluppare e migliorare la relazione con cittadini l uso di internet permette di raggiungere brevissimo tempo un ampio numero di cittadini utenti di rilevare facilmente loro bisogni oltre intercettare rumor e le fake news tempo reale da tenere inoltre presente che attraverso il web ed social medium le informazioni riescono ad essere diffuse velocemente basso costi e con un alta interattivit social medium sono diventati parte integrante della vita quotidiana e luoghi dove gli utenti si scambiano e cercano informazioni relative alla salute inoltre internet rappresenta un importante risorsa per le organizzazioni sanitarie anche perch permette di identificare influencer credibili da utilizzare per sviluppare campagne informative e divulgative la comunicazione attraverso social medium oltre ad avere delle peculiarit proprie risponde parte quelle che sono le caratteristiche intrinseche della comunicazione classica particolare la comunicazione deve essere un processo bidirezionale cui la fase di passaggio di informazioni si intercala ascolto inoltre per essere efficace deve essere accessibile ricevente deve cio condividere costrutti logici culturali e linguistici il messaggio deve essere chiaro e adattato ricevente la comunicazione inoltre dovrebbe essere completa ed esaustiva oltre che tempestiva soprattutto nel caso di emergenze sanitarie nel caso specifico anche social medium possono essere adoperati non solo per veicolare informazioni utente anche per acquisire informazioni sia merito ad argomenti prettamente di carattere sanitario timori relativi ai vaccini malattie infettive che relativi opinione che l utenza ha circa le organizzazioni sanitarie stesse ci implica per un monitoraggio continuo dei social e un analisi dei contenuti azioni che indubbiamente richiedono esperienza e tempo e potrebbero quindi costituire una sfida e un impegno di risorse notevoli da parte delle organizzazioni stesse tuttavia esistono strumenti automatici che possono fornire un valido supporto un problema di primaria importanza che si pone nell elaborazione del programma di comunicazione quello di assicurare l esistenza di una coerenza tra vari messaggi inviati modo che essi siano inseriti un unico disegno strategico che assicuri lo sviluppo di un legame di fiducia consenso e fedelt con propri fruitori ed generale con vari interlocutori altri terminus necessario pianificare e identificare degli obiettivi comunicativi attualmente diversi contesti sociopolitici piuttosto critici per la presenza di conflitti bellici le architetture per la salute si sono adattate per rispondere diverse esigenze di emergenza per esempio nell assuta hospital israele piani parcheggi interrati sono stati concepiti come dei veri e propri bunker e sono stati pertanto progettati per poter trasformarsi aree sanitarie e rispondere alla necessit emergenziale di garantire il servizio sanitario anche caso di attacco aereo la flessibilit degli spazi e delle organizzazioni risulta essere quindi un requisito fondamentale per far fronte diverse situazioni emergenziali siano esse temporanee prolungate nel tempo sul territorio nazionale invece si pu osservare come nell area del pronto soccorso dipartimento emergenza e accettazione degli ospedali italiani possibile trovare aree dedicate ad affrontare similari situazioni anche se meno consuete il caso dell area bioterrorismo decontaminazione e l area polifunzionale catastrofi emergenze composta da spazi polmone adatti ad ospitare un numero elevato di utenti sopraggiungere di specifiche situazioni di emergenza tali locali non afferiscono quegli spazi obbligatori che la normativa nazionale prescrive sotto forma di requisiti strutturali tecnologici ed organizzativi minimi per l esercizio delle attivit sanitarie da parte delle strutture pubbliche e private per decreto del presidente della repubblica del l analisi approfondita di alcune aree di pronto soccorso di recente realizzazione italia ha evidenziato che casi su possibile riscontrare la presenza di aree bioterrorismo decontaminazione mentre un solo caso si rilevata la presenza dell area polifunzionale catastrofi emergenze questi dati evidenziano una grande criticit e carenza di spazi per la gestione straordinaria delle emergenze attraverso le strutture ospedaliere italiane anche alla luce di recenti stime che propendono per una crescita sempre maggiore di emergenze per cause naturali e non gi continuo aumento la carenza di spazi dedicati interno delle aree di pronto soccorso per rispondere alle grandi emergenze la mancanza di una cultura diffusa sul tema e l obsolescenza della maggior parte delle strutture sanitarie italiane oltre il stato realizzato prima del porta ad individuare nell allestimento di campi di emergenza temporanei la soluzione pi ottimale e strategica attraverso la raccolta di informazioni riguardo la tematica delle strutture socio sanitarie e abitative per l emergenza per emerge una mancanza di competenze adeguate da parte di volontari e operatori che per le prime volta si sono trovati lavorare nell ambito della realizzazione di talus allestimenti pertanto emerge la necessit di proporre strategie organizzative e indicazioni progettuali sulla realizzazione e sul funzionamento dei campi di primo soccorso e di tutte le strutture adibite alla cura situazioni di emergenza che possono anche configurarsi come tendopoli l obiettivo quello di rispondere alle necessit di diffondere e rendere facilmente accessibili la conoscenza delle principali procedure attuabili condizioni di emergenza di vario genere supportati da un ampio campione di casi studio si sono distinti gli stessi tre grandi macro gruppi caratterizzanti le tre principali tipologie di emergenze ovvero legate ad una componente epidemica generate da un evento naturale climatico disastroso dovute problematiche sociali e politiche quali le guerre e migrazioni per la raccolta dei materiali utili seguita una prima fase di analisi di casi studio basata sulla tipologia di struttura relazionata alle dimensioni il numero di pazienti ospitabili e il numero di operatori necessari per gestirla il tutto quindi stato posto relazione alla tipologia di emergenza che la tendopoli la struttura sanitarium si trovavano dover affrontare una matrice di analisi basata su dati quantitativi quali l estensione la capacit ricettiva e la permanenza e qualitativi come l organizzazione logistica delle funzioni interne ha permesso di confrontare diversi casi studio internazionali l obiettivo di tale analisi la comprensione delle modalit di pianificazione e allestimento delle diverse tipologie di strutture per l urgenza partire dalla matrice di confronto casi studio sono stati sottoposti ad un analisi critica che ha permesso di analizzare le differenti funzioni loro interno la loro organizzazione e le relazioni spaziali e funzionali essere tra le diverse aree questa analisi ha permesso co di sviluppare una coscienza critica riguardo alle corrette modalit di realizzazione delle strutture questione e una maggior consapevolezza riguardo gli accorgimenti da mettere atto nelle fasi di progettazione e allestimento delle stesse il risultato finale si traduce una proposta meta progettuale di layout funzionali rispettivamente per ogni macro area e la definizione delle principali raccomandazioni che costituiscono un supporto alla realizzazione e allestimento del soccorso sanitario per le vittime colpite da calamit naturali problematiche socio politiche emergenza di carattere epidemico tali considerazioni suddivise base alle diverse tipologiche di evento catastrofico possono supportare decisori nella scelta delle strategie ottimali da attuare quali l individuazione dell area la programmazione delle fasi di soccorso e di insediamento e l applicazione delle relazioni funzionali e spaziali pi adeguate ed efficaci il lavoro di ricerca si pone dunque come punto di partenza per un pi approfondito studio riguardante le modalit che meglio si adattano ad ogni contesto di rischio per effettuare scelte consapevoli efficaci e coerenti rispetto alla tipologia di emergenza che ci si trova ad affrontare neisseria meningitidis meningococco un batterio gramnegativo responsabile di malattia invasiva meningite e sepsi con una incidenza nel nostro paese pari x abitanti dato provvisorio fonte sorveglianza nazionale delle malattie batteriche invasive istituto superiore di sanit iss che aumenta fino volta incidenza pari x abitanti dato provvisorio nei bambino di sotto di anno di gli adolescenti risultano essere il secondo gruppo di maggiormente affetto da questa malattia la mortalit stimata intorno e tra sopravvissuti si segnalano spesso gravi complicanze tra le malattie infettive ad esordio molto rapido per cui la prevenzione tramite vaccinazione rimane l unica possibilit per limitare il diffondersi del meningococco l epidemiologia molecolare gioca un ruolo fondamentale nell ambito delle attivit di sorveglianza sia corso di un outbreak che per valutazioni relative alla variabilit genetica dei ceppi circolanti appartenenti diversi cloni iper virulenti infine le indagini molecolari tramite analisi dell intero genoma permettono di valutare la presenza assenza di un gene codificante un antigene vaccinale e la presenza di varianti proteiche tutto quanto premesso di particolare rilevanza per il controllo della malattia invasiva da meningococco di sierogruppob menb relazione ai vaccini attualmente disposizione vaccini disponibili contengono infatti antigeni sub capsulari antigeni proteici soggetti una elevata variabilit tra ceppo e ceppo di sierogruppo b e con un livello di espressione variabile per uno stesso ceppo stato condotto uno studio di tipizzazione molecolare su campioni positivi per meningococco di sierogruppo b segnalati sistema di sorveglianza nazionale dal e inviati per le indagini molecolari iss particolare stato analizzato il complesso clonale di appartenenza e le varianti fhbp componente principale di uno dei due vaccini antimeningococco b licenziati italia complessivamente isolati di menb hanno mostrato la sottofamiglia fhbp e la sottofamiglia b fhbp e le sottovarianti pi frequentemente identificate le varianti e b di fhbp sono distribuite modo diverso rispetto alle dei pazienti da cui il ceppo stato isolato ceppi di menb sono stati caratterizzati da una notevole associazione tra complesso clonale e varianti di fhbp nel periodo preso esame una buona rappresentazione di entrambe le famiglie e b di fhbp stato inoltre identificata sebbene relativamente rara l infezione da meningococco riconosciuta come un grave problema di salute pubblica causa degli alti tassi di morbilit e mortalit associati alla malattia meningococcica invasiva inoltre focolai dovuti questo patogeno non sono rari e menb continuum essere una causa significativa di malattia negli adolescenti e nei giovani adulti potrebbero verificarsi cambiamenti dinamici alcune varianti evidenziando la necessit di una continuum sorveglianza basata sul genoma per riconoscere l emergere e l espansione di nuovi cloni particolare quelli caratterizzati da nuove varianti e di indagare e infine prevedere potenziali fallimenti del vaccino uniti questo incremento di incidenza potrebbe essere spiegato con la misdiagnosi mancata identificazione di talus forme nel passato strumentazione microbiologica e radiologica poco sensibile e specifica oppure con l incremento di soggetti rischio di malattia immunocompromissione da comorbidit da terapie immunosoppressive con le variazioni di patogenicit e virulenza di specie di ntm con maggiore esposizione serbatoi ambientali ci che risulta significativo il cambio epidemiologico ambito di micobatteri con le forme di malattia sostenute da tuberculosis riduzione ed incremento dell incidenza di ntm ld una sorta di replacement ecologico che tuttavia non possiede specifiche motivazioni scientifiche allo stato attuale le morti attribuibili agli ntm sostenute soprattutto da avium complex xenopi e da altri micobatteri lenta crescita hanno mostrato trend temporali variabili con incremento vari contesti geografici spiegabili con la ritardata diagnosi associata ad un aggravamento prognostico con la somministrazione di terapie antibiotiche non mirate e con l interessamento di gruppi di popolazione particolarmente vulnerabili la mortalit pazienti con broncopneumopatia cronica ostruttiva il peggioramento della prognosi alcuni casi pu essere spiegato dall insorgenza di forme sostenute da ceppi di micobatteri antibiotico resistenti tale fenomeno crescita determinati contesti dove alcuni antibiotici sono utilizzati empiricamente ed maniera inappropriata per altre forme cliniche pu essere inducibile resistenza innata acquisito esposizione concentrazioni sub ottimali di antibiotici nel dosaggio e nella frequenza di somministrazione gli indicatori di mortalit ed incidenza vanno tuttavia analizzati nell ambito del triangolo epidemiologico ospite microrganismo ed ambiente l ospite potrebbe presentare maggiore sensibilit infezione alla malattia e maggiore rischio di decesso per specifici trait

ospite target anatomici per ntm ad esempio polmone la relazione illustrer lo stato di avanzamento delle tre principali iniziative europee che hanno rilevanza per la ricerca sulle cause delle disuguaglianze di salute e per la promozione di politiche di loro contrasto e di moderazione del loro impatto l iniziativa di allea e feam le associazioni europee delle accademie rispettivamente delle scienze e di medicina su health inequality interdisciplinary exploration socioeconomic position health causality mira costruire consenso intorno alle questioni pi controverse tra discipline economiche e sociali sul nesso di causalit tra determinanti sociali e salute il dibattito ancora aperto sulla direzione della causalit le prove di causazione inversa tra reddito e classe occupazionale da un lato ed effetti sfavorevoli sulla salute dall altro sono almeno altrettanto se non pi importanti di quelle della causazione diretta mentre le prove sulla causazione mediata dalle disuguaglianze nella esposizione ai principali fattori di rischio sulla salute sono solide le implicazioni per le politiche sono che ogni strategia e intervento che miri ridurre le disuguaglianze di esposizione ai principali fattori di rischio sarebbe grado di ridurre significativamente le disuguaglianze di salute mentre l efficacia delle politiche distributive non ancora dotata di prove giudicate adeguate da tutte le parti scientifiche dalle scienze economiche particolare una nuova iniziativa dell ufficio della regione europea dell organizzazione mondiale della sanit health equity status report ehsr mira costruire consenso tra governi dei paesi della regione europea dell oms su una formula per rendere esigibile la responsabilit delle politiche nel ridurre le disuguaglianze evitabili di salute questa formula comprende sia un atlante periodicamente aggiornato delle disuguaglianze di salute su scala nazionale indicatori di salute di esposizione fattori di rischio di esposizione determinanti sociali di implementazione di politiche distributive e di moderazione delle conseguenze delle disuguaglianze sia un insieme di strumenti di guida per la scelta di politiche e interventi utili per contrastare moderare le disuguaglianze di salute il primo rapporto stato rilasciato pubblico met settembre e stanno iniziando progetti di trasferimento di questo modello di reporting accountability ai paesi che intendono applicarlo livello subnazionale nel caso italiano per coinvolgere le regioni la nuova joint action della unione europea sulle disuguaglianze di salute jahee joint action health equity europe si propone di accompagnare paesi membri partecipanti migliorare la capacit di risposta politica ai bisogni di maggiore equit per la salute attraverso concrete azioni di innovazione su cinque campi di

tutte le politiche l italia ha la responsabilit di guidare jahee attraverso un consorzio di iss agenas inmp ministero della salute e piemonte ha inoltre una posizione privilegiata nella partecipazione hesr quanto sede del venice office che ne esecutore e quanto campo privilegiato di sperimentazione di una applicazione subnazionale dell hesr infine l italia partecipa panel di esperti delle accademie delle scienze e di medicina e concorre ad organizzare workshop interdisciplinari che saranno chiamati costruire consenso intorno alle questioni di causalit pi controverse il seminario offrir l occasione per interpellare la comunit professionale degli igienisti circa il ruolo che la sanit pubblica italiana pu giocare queste due agende della ricerca sui determinanti sociali di salute e dei progressi nelle capacit di risposta delle politiche nella programmazione sanitarium e quindi nell orientamento delle risorse disposizione fondamentale il contributo dell epidemiologia un epidemiologia pi indirizzata ad essere strumento di servizio piuttosto che di sola ricerca si tratta di quella epidemiologia di campo che sintetizza il rigore metodologico e quindi le relative competenze tecniche associate ad una naturale propensione approccio di ricerca con il ruolo di servizio che insito nel momento cui opera interno del dipartimento di prevenzione delle aziende sanitarie pubbliche di fondo gli strumenti di cui necessita un epidemiologia di questo genere sono competenze ed esperienze nel campo delle sorveglianze sanitarie orientate alla osservazione di informazioni di natura sia quantitativa che qualitativa nella realizzazione di profili di salute strutturati non solo su indicatori di stato anche su indicatori dinamici che permettono la costruzione di scenari nella partecipazione con altri soggetti pubblici e privati alla realizzazione di profili di comunit che rappresentino una lettura ragionata e partecipata dei bisogni di salute e di benessere di una popolazione pratica uno strumento di vero supporto individuazione delle criticit e delle priorit da considerare interno della programmazione e delle politiche territoriali sociali socio sanitarie e sanitarie nella costruzione di profili delle disuguaglianze risposta alle esigenze sempre pi forti di applicare veri criteri di equit accesso ai servizi riconosciuto come l obiettivo hard della sanit pubblica sia lo sviluppo di percorsi di promozione della salute che coniugano gli interventi di prevenzione primaria e secondaria con quelli sulla comunit questi ultimi pi interessati coinvolgimento alla partecipazione ed alla condivisione di percorsi modo da creare consapevolezza ed avere strumenti adeguati per affrontare tematiche di salute spesso richiedenti competenze life skill e soprattutto propensione cambiamento tale piano stato sviluppato con l intento di migliorare lo stato di salute della popolazione presente negli stabili attraverso l offerta attiva di prestazioni sanitarie l educazione alla salute e l orientamento ai servizi occasioni di incontri svolti direttamente nei luoghi di vita e dedicati specifiche tematiche giornate per l accessibilit l iniziativa maturata nel solco delle esperienze gi intraprese dall inmp e dalle asl metropolitane con migranti transito e risultano particolarmente importanti sia per l assistenza sociosanitaria garantita sia per il modello sperimentato centrato sulle aziende sanitarie un ottica di rete intesa come sistema dialogante di una pluralit di attori e professionalit differenti per la realizzazione delle attivit sono stati individuati seguenti stabili insistenti sul territorio via croce gerusalemme roma via cardinal domenico capranica roma gli interventi hanno avuto nel loro complesso lo scopo di avvicinare gli operatori dei servizi socio sanitari alla popolazione alloggiata negli stabili occupati e quest ultima ai servizi sanitari e socio sanitari territoriali sono stati contattati comitati di gestione degli edifici qualit di organi di rappresentanza delle popolazioni ivi soggiornanti laddove presenti figure chiave delle comunit residenti per la condivisione degli obiettivi del piano e l acquisizione di informazioni relative contesto e alle caratteristiche della popolazione presente sono stati inoltre organizzati incontri e focus group con referenti interno degli edifici e con alcuni abitanti per discutere e concordare contenuti le modalit e la tempistica degli interventi il piano di intervento stato strutturato come percorso di formazione accreditato ecm rivolto agli operatori dei servizi territoriali delle asl medici infermieri assistenti sociali ostetriche e psicologi che ha coniugato momenti di approfondimento aula con esperienze sul campo formando gli operatori accoglienza e alla relazione transculturale un ottica di mediazione di sistema sono state sviluppate le conoscenze merito alla normativa relativa accesso ai servizi sanitari da parte della popolazione immigrata offrendo un supporto alla decostruzione del pregiudizio e allo sviluppo di competenze culturali e relazionali per la gestione di casi complessi e ad alto impatto relazionale interno degli edifici sono state realizzate complessivamente giornate nell arco temporale giugno giugno vista la diversit degli stabili per dimensioni caratteristiche logistiche e profilo della popolazione presente la modalit di svolgimento degli interventi stata improntata alla massima flessibilit tenendo conto della limitata disponibilit di risorse strutturali e organizzative nell ambito di talus giornate stata svolta un attivit di educazione sanitarium su vari temi anche mediante la distribuzione di materiale informativo diritto alla salute e accesso ai servizi sanitari dei cittadini ue e extra ue salute e benessere del bambino salute e benessere della donna stili di vita e patologie croniche stato realizzato un orientamento attivo ai servizi sanitari territoriali mediante l utilizzo di mappe di fruibilit appositamente realizzate per ciascuno degli stabili oggetto dell intervento e contenenti indicazioni semplici e fruibili sui servizi presenti inoltre sono state erogate prestazioni sanitarie socio sanitarie e psicologiche minime e laddove necessario gli utenti sono stati inviati ai servizi territoriali per ulteriori approfondimenti diagnostici contatti avvenuti tra professionisti e persone interno degli stabili sono stati documentati mediante compilazione di una scheda appositamente predisposta il piano rivolto alle popolazioni rom e sinti presenti presso alcuni insediamenti della capitale caratterizzati da elevata criticit e identificati dalle asl territorialmente competenti come setting prioritari di intervento considerazione della diversit degli insediamenti per dimensione caratteristiche logistiche e ubicazione si richiesta una certa flessibilit nella scelta delle strategie di svolgimento degli interventi le condizione generali di marginalit e lontananza dai servizi unitamente alla necessit di avviare tempestivamente azioni di tutela e promozione della salute hanno portato comunque privilegiare il ricorso strategie di outreach da attuare direttamente presso gli insediamenti grazie personale sanitario che si reso disponibile collaborare progetto e ausilio di unit sanitarie mobili sono state organizzate giornate per la salute finalizzate creare occasioni di incontro tra gli operatori e le persone presenti il progetto si articolato tre principali processi costruzione di un gruppo di ricerca interdisciplinare ha visto la partecipazione di realt istituzionali socio sanitarie asl inmp dep universitarie e locali comune municipio creazione di un modello organizzativo di ricerca azione ed intervento comunitario integrato attivit di presa carico e orientamento ai servizi stata adottata una metodologia community based combinata con un rigoroso approccio analitico attraverso metodologie quantitative studio trasversale descrittivo e qualitative come focus group consultazioni della popolazione e la somministrazione di questionari sorveglianza di popolazione passi ecc la creazione di rapporti inter istituzionali tra soggetti del gruppo di ricerca azione ha permesso di realizzare una prima fase finalizzata ad indagare la presenza di eventuali disuguaglianze sociali di salute tra bastogi e contesti urbani circostanti mediante la somministrazione di questionari volti ad esplorare vari fattori di rischio fattori di rischio e la possibilit di accesso ai servizi socio sanitari della popolazione la costruzione di un intervento richiede la partecipazione di pi soggetti istituzionali e non e il coinvolgimento della popolazione fine di costruire interventi capaci di agire contesti estremamente difficili attraverso processi decisionali partecipativi lo sviluppo di metodologie partecipate ed inclusive appare quindi una strategia fondamentale per migliorare lo stato di salute di popolazioni vulnerabili contesti urbani saper innovare sanit significa avere la capacit di trasformare le buone idee realt applicative nella pratica clinica e di sanit pubblica garantendo singoli pazienti e popolazioni esiti di salute migliori trasparenti e misurabili per farlo imprescindibile facilitare una sempre maggior integrazione tra il mondo della ricerca life science e dell innovazione tecnologica con il mondo dell organizzazione sanitarium raggiungendo per gradi anche attraverso singole robuste progettualit pilota evidenze da ampliare su scala regionale e nazionale va ricordato che innovazione innovation non sinonimo di innovativit innovativeness una caratteristica che resta legata contesto ed alla cultura delle organizzazioni nonch alla loro capacit di essere permeabili alle novit efficaci e vantaggiose il numero di pazienti che hanno la possibilit di beneficiare modo rapido ed equo di una nuova tecnologia grado di soddisfare lo specifico bisogno di salute che misura l innovativit di un sistema sanitario tra le possibilit offerte dall innovazione tecnologiche negli ultimi anni di particolare interesse per il mondo sanitario la sfida della digitalizzazione secondo l organizzazione mondiale della sanit la digitalizzazione sanit rappresenta la risposta alla sfida di garantire l accesso cure sanitarie di qualit tutta la popolazione universal health coverage un contesto di risorse finite e nel rispetto della sostenibilit dei sistemi sanitari difatti oggi la principale sfida di tutti sistemi sanitari evoluti rispondere efficacemente crescente bisogno di salute della popolazione attraverso l allocazione efficiente di risorse sanitarie sempre pi ristrette e la creazione di valore sia per il singolo sia per la comunit questa sfida si manifesta molteplici scenari particolare per le patologie cronico degenerative complice la transizione epidemiologica e l aumento dell aspettativa di vita della popolazione sempre secondo l oms questo senso la digitalizzazione delle organizzazioni sanitarie potrebbe colmare modo efficace ed efficiente il gap esistente tra la domanda di salute e l offerta di servizi sociosanitari permettendoci di passare attraverso una trasformazione evolutiva dirompente disruptive innovation dalla sanit esistente alla sanit che dovrebbe essere focus del potenziale digitale la gestione del dato e la capacit di trasformare dati sempre pi granulari e specifici informazioni rilevanti nella pratica clinica e di sanit pubblica la societ con particolare riferimento agli asset produttivi finanziari ha iniziato considerare dati come la risorsa pi preziosa oggi disposizione superando il petrolio nelle strategie di investimento pi accorte il paragone tuttavia pur essendo di per di immediata comprensione non corretto quanto mentre il petrolio una risorsa via di esaurimento la raccolta di dati contrario assoluta espansione inoltre mentre il petrolio una risorsa di propriet di pochi dati sanitari sono per natura un patrimonio della singola persona prima ancora che della societ pertanto sembra pi corretto dire che dati sanitari sono preziosi come il sangue e come talus dovrebbero essere maneggiati trattandoli con il rigore l attenzione e la cautela riservati ai campioni biologici si stima che il tempo necessario per raddoppiare le conoscenze mediche sia passato da anni nel ad uno stimato di anni entro il l intelletto umano quindi non gi pi grado di gestire la complessit dei dati raccolti e delle conseguenti informazioni per garantire la protezione e fruibilit di questa mole di dati e informazioni di cui oggi disponiamo quantit e specificit mai avuti prima nella storia dell umanit alcune tecnologie digitali possono essere di interesse un ottica di sanit pubblica sanit pubblica metodi e le tecniche computazionali per l analisi dei dati si sono evoluti per decenni alcuni di questi metodi sono diventati collettivamente noti come intelligenza artificiale l intelligenza artificiale costituisce un vasto insieme di metodi computazionali che producono sistemi che svolgono azioni e compiti che normalmente richiedono intelligenza umana questi metodi computazionali comprendono titolo esemplificativo il riconoscimento di immagini automatiche l elaborazione del linguaggio naturale e l apprendimento automatico tuttavia sanit un termine pi appropriato sembra essere intelligenza aumentata che riflette le capacit potenziate del processo decisionale umano se abbinato questi metodi e sistemi computazionali artificiali machine learning la maggior parte degli approcci di apprendimento automatico si articola due categorie principali widespread use internet social media among general population recent year ha interested wide range area related public health need

innovazioni dell e health avranno sempre un maggiore impatto sul sistema sanitario che andr adeguatamente governato per coglierne appieno benefici e fronteggiare le grandi sfide della sanit di oggi e soprattutto di domani nel processo di riorganizzazione chiave e health del sistema sanitario il cittadino paziente occuper una posizione preminente quanto sar il protagonista nelle scelte che lo riguardano ed il gestore diretto delle sue informazioni sanitarie fattori strategici e abilitanti di questo cambiamento saranno la tecnologia inscindibilmente congiunta innovazione organizzativa e di processo l innovazione digitale sar dirompente visto che le nuove tecnologie andranno ad incidere nell intero percorso che va dalla prevenzione alla cura assistenza e follow mediante strumenti come il fascicolo sanitario elettronico la telemedicina le terapie digitali ecc inoltre si svilupperanno nuovi touchpoint con la sanit da parte dei cittadini con siti web app chatbot ecc visto che social medium e servizi mobili saranno sempre pi pervasivi sistemi informativi sanitari ovvero l insieme dei flussi di informazione gestiti interno dell organizzazione sanitarium utili alla misura ed alla valutazione dei processi gestionali e clinici saranno chiamati mediante la loro architettura ad assicurare il sempre pi complesso livello operativo di controllo e di governo delle aziende sanitarie tenendo debita considerazione lo sviluppo dei nuovi sistemi integrati regionali di area occorrer per fare conti con sistemi tecnologici preesistenti volta obsoleti comunque eterogenei con culture organizzative diverse e disomogenee e con trasformazioni organizzative l e health potr supportare problemi di sostenibilit economica e di garanzia dei servizi essenziali di assistenza erogati anche fronte di una domanda incrementale e difficilmente governabile con paradigmi attuali riguardo ad ambiti come la cronicit e l invecchiamento della popolazione l attuazione diffusa della teleassistenza e del telemonitoraggio consentir l accompagnamento sicuro persone fragili ed anziani sperimentando servizi smart casa propria sia per la sfera sociale spesa pasti ecc che per l assistenza infermieristica principali fattori determinati il successo di interventi e health identificati livello internazionale sono la qualit delle cure il miglioramento nella diagnosi il clinical management e la gestione dei flussi di lavoro professionisti sanitari identificano comunque delle barriere nella sanit digitale riguardanti l allineamento con processi clinici la modifica dei ruoli la mancanza di comunicazione face face con pazienti non trascurabili sono costi particolare se devono essere assicurati mediante finanziamenti pubblici dovranno essere opportunamente valutati nel contesto italiano principali processi caratterizzati da evoluzione nell ambito socio sanitario che inducono cambiamenti organizzativi quelli pi rilevanti attengono alla revisione dell organizzazione dei presidi ospedalieri alla riorganizzazione complessiva della sanit regionale alla revisione dei processi di presa carico dei pazienti alla razionalizzazione presidi ospedalieri sul territorio alla centralizzazione acquisti dei processi clinici socio sanitari dei processi amministrativi hr dei processi ict dei servizi diagnostici e dei servizi emergenza urgenza non apparir pi possibile fare innovazione e cambiamenti di processi organizzativi sostenibili sanit senza un utilizzo diffuso dei sistemi informativi che assumeranno quindi un ruolo cruciale come lev strategica di cambiamento aziendale per operare questo cambiamento sar basilare l e leadership non solo per chief information officer ed tecnici esperti anche per le professioni sanitarie quale capacit di guidare l innovazione organizzativa verso modelli interdisciplinari e interprofessionali fortemente integrati e basati su comunit virtuali di pratica per l e health la governance dell innovazione digitale dovr comprendere tutti livelli istituzionali da quello europeo quello nazionale governo ministero agenzia per l italia digitale quello regionale regioni societ house ed quello aziendale pertanto livello nazionale andr assicurato principalmente il quadro normativo e regolatorio per il supporto per l accesso ai finanziamenti la definizione di standard e infrastrutture materiali ed immateriali e la semplificazione normativa livello regionale andr garantita la programmazione e lo sviluppo mediante la messa disposizione di risorse economiche la definizione di linee guida regionali la definizione di obiettivi comuni e convergenti livello aziendale dovr essere sostenuta l attuazione e la gestione dall acquisizione di cultura riguardante l innovazione digitale sviluppando adeguate competenze nell utilizzo delle soluzioni ict per andare verso il sistema sanitario smart occorrer perseguire un armonico sviluppo delle seguenti componenti servizi infrastrutturali anagrafica regionale piattaforme di integrazione infrastruttura dedicata data center bc dr ecc servizi cittadino ricette elettroniche servizi di prenotazione e pagamento esami e visite app mobile consultazione documentazione clinica sanitarium servizi supporto dei processi clinico sanitari e assistenziali fse pacs pdta informatizzati telemedicina certificati di malattia reti di patologia ecc servizi amministrativi sistema erp

per l intelligenza artificiale per l ambito salute trover applicazioni con la chirurgia assistita con la robotica intelligente l assistenza infermieristica virtuale il supporto alla diagnostica per immagini la gestione dei fascicoli sanitari elettronici inoltre trover applicazioni per l ambito previdenza sociale principalmente per il supporto agli individui con disabilit per incrementare l inclusione sociale di categorie di cittadini svantaggiati e per soddisfare nuovi bisogni derivanti dall invecchiamento della popolazione l intelligenza artificiale potr dare impulso innovazione ed alla predisposizione di standard condivisi nelle varie regioni nel contesto sanitario ci sar pertanto il bisogno di promuovere il possesso di nuovi skill per la governance e la reingegnerizzazione di processi e per la gestione del change management per tutti gli stakeholder che utilizzano le ict fine di garantire una visione insieme coerente pertanto si dovranno costruire percorsi di formazione universitari e post universitari il cui obiettivo formativo il governo della tecnologia tra figure diverse professionisti sanitari tecnici gestori esperti di processo di organizzazione cio ecc che saranno coinvolti team multidisciplinari che integrino le competenze tecnologiche digitali organizzative e di processo e che governino il percorso insieme management inoltre sar basilare definire percorsi di crescita equilibrata delle componenti di servizio ict con queste premesse alla domanda e health e assetti organizzativi nuove opportunit per le professioni sanitarie possibile rispondere che le principali utilit si potranno ricavare dall integrazione organizzativa delle professioni sanitarie con evolute competenze su un numero sempre pi ampio di servizi supporto dei processi di

hanno acquisito un ruolo specifico per il progresso della medicina e dell assistenza sanitarium e sono diventate una forza trainante nella ricerca e nella pratica medica il progresso genomica accompagnato da un aumento della disponibilit incontrollata di test genetici sia per malattie monogeniche che complesse ha assunto implicazioni cruciali per la salute pubblica perch offre l opportunit di differenziare individui e gruppi con maggiori probabilit di sviluppare determinate condizioni patologiche e questo con nuovi modi rispetto quelli tradizionalmente usati dagli operatori della salute negli ultimi due decenni l uso di le parole che terminano con omic si sono estese dall iniziale genomica ad una vasta gamma di discipline biomolecolari indirizzate allo studio di aspetti specifici studiando pool di molecole e ioni acidi nucleici proteine enzimi con varie funzioni interno degli organismi viventi la diffusione delle discipline omiche stata possibile principalmente attraverso lo sviluppo di tecnologie high throughput grado di generare un grande quantit di dati relativi ai diversi livelli di complessit biologica dna mrna proteine metaboliti ecc contribuendo rivoluzionare l approccio allo studio di organismi viventi le tecnologie omics come il next generation sequencing ngs hanno un vasto potenziale applicativo che vanno dall aumentare la comprensione dei diversi processi fisiologici e fisiopatologici loro utilizzo screening diagnosi e valutazione della storia naturale risposta alla terapia e prognosi di vari disturbi la pletora di tecnologie ad alto rendimento disponibili per le scienze omiche e la loro rapida evoluzione richiede alla comunit scientifica di superare il divario tra la produzione di dati omici e progresso delle tecnologie high throughput da un lato e la capacit di gestire integrare analizzare e interpretare questa enorme quantit di dati dall altro nella prospettiva che nel prossimo decennio la genomica e altre scienze omiche giocheranno un ruolo decisivo interno di big data la complessit delle scienze omiche e relative applicazioni come la medicina personalizzata certamente richiede una governance dai sistemi sanitari implementare un approccio personalizzato assistenza sanitarium richieder anche un cambiamento nell organizzazione dei servizi sanitari una prospettiva pi ampia leader della sanit pubblica sono responsabili di aiutare catalizzare il cambiamento nell organizzazione dei servizi sanitari definendo politiche pubbliche capaci di assicurare che la genomica e le altre tecnologie siano utilizzate per il miglior effetto il modo cui il sistema sanitario pubblico si adatter questi nuovi scenari sar un determinante significativo della possibilit che la personalizzazione dell assistenza sanitarium possa alla fine portare maggiori guadagni nella salute generale della popolazione bench come osserva anche l oms sia ancora necessario cogliere meglio il potenziale e limiti della genomica nella genesi delle malattie e investire educazione e ricerca per raggiungere gli obiettivi di sanit pubblica pochi paesi hanno implementato una politica nazionale strutturata italia nel la conferenza stato regioni approvava le linee di indirizzo su la genomica sanit pubblica un ulteriore passo stato recentemente fatto con l approvazione di un piano nazionale per l innovazione del sistema sanitario basata sulle scienze omiche questo piano soddisfa la sfida di un approccio globale innovazione tenendo conto che tale l innovazione profondamente intrecciata con la crescita economica del paese particolare intorno argomento trasversale dell secondo anche le indicazioni dell ocse il piano mira anche sostenere l attenta implementazione e l uso intelligente del big data nel settore sanitario e favorire il raggiungimento di benefici significativi sia per la salute della popolazione che per il sistema economico il piano si impegna anche implementare le recenti conclusioni del consiglio dell unione europea sulla medicina personalizzata il piano delinea modi cui l innovazione delle conoscenze nel campo biologico dovrebbe riformare il sistema sanitario nazionale nelle aree di prevenzione diagnosi e cura tenendo conto dell efficacia basata sull evidenza e della sostenibilit costo efficacia per migliorare la salute dell individuo e della popolazione il piano ha lo scopo di supportare il servizio sanitario nazionale ordine aumentare la consapevolezza di tutte le parti interessate merito innovazione basata sulle scienze omiche e dei suoi effetti sulla salute di individui e popolazioni migliorando la capacit della societ di far fronte agli aspetti culturale etico psicologico della rivoluzione genomica mettere atto una strategia di governo dell innovazione della genomica valutare e implementare le opportunit attualmente offerte dalle scienze omiche per la salute della popolazione gli obiettivi principali del piano nazionale sono trasferire la conoscenza genomica nella pratica dei servizi sanitari un approccio incentrato sul paziente aumentare l efficacia della prevenzione diagnosi e trattamento delle malattie tenendo conto delle differenze individuali nel patrimonio genetico negli stili di vita e nell ambiente e fornire ai professionisti le risorse necessarie per personalizzare gli interventi promuovere l innovazione culturale scientifica e tecnologica del sistema sanitario il piano si concentra su diversi argomenti tra cui la genomica nella diagnosi delle malattie mendeliane e complesse e tumori la prevenzione personalizzata test pre concezionali test pre e postnatali screening neonatale genomica terapia farmacogenomica e terapia personalizzata dei tumor inoltre il piano evidenzia quali sono funzioni del governo centrale e le azioni da sostenere per l attuazione del piano fornisce anche le principale indicazioni per favorire la ricerca e l innovazione nel seguenti ambiti big data e medicina computazionale tale scenario la risolutivit dei servizi nei confronti dei bisogni di salute richiede la centralit della promozione di salute attraverso un approccio proattivo e partecipato multidisciplinare e intersettoriale che tenga conto della matrice sociale e relazionale dei processi di salute e malattia e il superamento della medicina di attesa verso quella di iniziativa pi di anni dalla dichiarazione di alma ata l organizzazione mondiale della sanit oms ne ha confermato valori e principi affermando che la primary health care phc rappresenta l approccio necessario per ridurre le disuguaglianze salute e per favorire l accesso universale un assistenza centrata sulla persona e sulla popolazione e la costruzione di comunit sane ovvero la prevenzione primaria anche italia la riorganizzazione delle cure primarie rappresenta un elemento inderogabile riguardo diverse sono le esperienze positive dai modelli di micro aree alle case della salute e ospedali di comunit la formazione sanit pubblica cosa insegnare un mondo che cambium la sanit pubblica avendo come proprio scopo quello di individuare e rispondere ai molteplici e variabili bisogni di salute della societ cui opera ha visto nel tempo un continuo rinnovamento dei suoi temi e strumenti di conseguenza anche curriculum formativi necessitano di un regolare aggiornamento nei metodi e nei contenuti le societ scientifiche di concerto con le universit possono essere un luogo importante di scambio interprofessionale e intergenerazionale per portare avanti l innovazione ambito formativo con questo intervento proveremo riflettere alla luce di esperienze nazionali ed europee su quali azioni la consulta degli specializzandi e gli altri organi societari potranno intraprendere nel prossimo anno per potenziare il suo ruolo nella formazione degli specializzandi igiene e medicina preventiva verso nuove frontiere una carriera di ricerca sanit pubblica oggi nella sessione dedicata alla ricerca scientifica ci si propone di delineare una guida percorso di carriera accademica e una descrizione del panorama della ricerca italiana sanit pubblica individuando strumenti pratici per affrontare le sfide legate alla competitivit del mondo scientifico alla necessit di adottare un approccio trasversale diverse discipline per rispondere bisogni di salute continuo cambiamento e alla valutazione critica di aspetti quali la valutazione della qualit della ricerca la professione igienistica e la sfida del task shifting la prospettiva dei giovani medici sanit pubblica il raggiungimento degli obiettivi di salute tramite un utilizzo pi effi ciente delle scarse risorse disponibili oggigiorno sempre pi correlato alla valorizzazione e razionalizzazione delle diverse competenze tecniche che si interfacciano interno di gruppi di lavoro multidisciplinari e multiprofessionali da realizzarsi anche attraverso una chiara definizione di ruoli e responsabilit dei differenti attori coinvolti superando logiche gerarchiche questa congiuntura cui sempre pi evidente la necessit di una riorganizzazione dei servizi sulla base dei nuovi bisogni socio assistenziali e di salute emersi occorre pertanto fare di necessit virt e scorgere nuove opportunit laddove gli altri vedano problemi la multiprofessionalit intesa come risorsa e il task shifting come utile strumento per migliorare la qualit del sistema con questo workshop noi medici formazione specialistica ci siamo messi gioco ampliando l orizzonte della formazione verso una sanit pubblica grado di rispondere ai bisogni dei cittadini e garantire la sostenibilit del servizio sanitario nazionale sinergie e prospettive traversi dip scienze sanit pubblica e pediatriche universit di torino lo studio del microbioma umano intestinale e della sua influenza sulla salute rapida espansione dalla conclusione della prima parte del human microbiome project ed seguito alla diffusione di metodi di analisi avanzati di biologia molecolare si arrivati produrre pi di prodotti della ricerca censiti su pubmed nel questo ambito di ricerca sebbene il microbiota umano sia costituito da microrganismi eucarioti archaea virus e batteri quest ultima componente ad oggi maggiormente studiata e conosciuta batteri presenti nel corpo umano sono numericamente medium volta pi numerosi delle cellule umane presentando un bagaglio di geni di diversi ordini di grandezza maggiore dei geni umani questi microrganismi contribuiscono funzioni fondamentali per l uomo per esempio nella produzione di vitamine nell assimilazione di nutrienti nell interazione e stimolazione del sistema immunitario ecc una crescente disponibilit di dati sono stati prodotti dimostrando cambiamenti nella composizione del microbiota particolare intestinale numerosi stati patologici che includono malattie infettive metaboliche del sistema immunitario tumorali e neurologiche la modulazione del microbiota potrebbe essere un importante prospettiva terapeutica soprattutto nell ottica della medicina personalizzata sebbene permangano degli ostacoli nella validazione tecnica e bioinformatica si sta procedendo verso delle procedure maggiormente condivise e standardizzate altra parte il microbiota umano influenzato da numerosi fattori ivi inclusa l interazione con il microbioma ambientale e non ancora chiaro quali possano essere le prospettive terminus di prevenzione primaria e secondaria l intervento per la modulazione del microbiota include prevalentemente il trapianto di microbiota fecale la somministrazione di probiotici e prebiotici e la modifica degli stili di vita ivi inclusa l alimentazione attraverso gli studi di metagenomica e le tecnologie di whole genome sequencing possibile considerare la complessit del genoma umano contenuto un campione ivi incluso il bagaglio ascrivibile microbioma inoltre la metabolomica pu fornire delle conferme rispetto alla presenza ed attivit delle varie componenti microbiche alcuni esempi particolare riferiti alla patologia diabetica ed tumore del colon possono fornire un esempio di sistema integrato di prevenzione prospettiva auspicabile che anche italia possa essere disponibile una valutazione microbiomica che specularmente quanto valutato per la genomica sia opportunamente interpretata e costo efficace modo da avere una ricaduta effettiva per la salute pubblica il modello di salute pubblica tema di vaccinazioni si fonda essenzialmente sul principio generale della stessa dose per tutti per ogni malattia che rappresenta l attuale approccio scientifico e normativo per la prevenzione delle malattie infettive per le quali sia disponibile un vaccino peraltro prescindendo dall aggiunta di sostanze adiuvanti che potenziano la risposta immunitaria artificiale attiva ad oggi la progettazione di nuove formulazioni vaccinali grado di superare problematiche legate ad esempio cambiamento della struttura demografica della popolazione e della distribuzione delle cause di malattia e di morte stata piuttosto limitata linea con la necessit di sviluppare programmi vaccinali destinati principalmente pediatrica questo scenario comunque di grande successo per la sanit pubblica avendo garantito l eradicazione ed il controllo di malattie infettive che fino non molto tempo fa determinavano mortalit e invalidit nella popolazione diventa sempre pi cogente prendere ulteriormente considerazione alcune condizioni che influenzano la risposta vaccinale come l immunosenescenza la presenza di un sistema immunitario immaturo le condizioni di salute come obesit e sovrappeso ed fattori non modificabili come il sesso linea con notevoli progressi che la medicina personalizzata sta facendo molti campi della salute umana il complesso delle scienze omiche ovvero le discipline che utilizzano tecnologie di analisi che forniscono grandi quantit di dati utili per la descrizione e l interpretazione dei sistemi biologici studiati potr essere applicato maniera sempre pi consistente allo sviluppo di nuovi vaccini orientati ad una migliore personalizzazione della pratica vaccinale vantaggio della qualit della risposta immune e detrimento del rischio di eventi avversi soprattutto se gravi questo solco la vaccinomica e l avversomica mirano comprendere le cause delle variazioni nelle risposte immunitarie ai vaccini negli esseri umani co come le cause degli eventi avversi ad essi associati questi nuovi campi di ricerca stanno sempre pi delineando una nuova frontiera della vaccinologia che superando l approccio empirico del passato pone attenzione su ogni aspetto della risposta vaccinale la vaccinomica e l avversomica indagano l influenza della regolazione genetica e non genetica sulla variabilit della risposta immune ai vaccini livello sia individuale sia di popolazione particolare la vaccinomica studia lo sviluppo di vaccini personalizzati basati sulla comprensione dell immunogenetica immunogenomica della risposta immunitaria occupandosi dell insieme dei geni che influenzano la risposta ai vaccini effetti determinanti immunogenetici implicati nella risposta individuale alle vaccinazioni sono numerosi e tra questi il complesso maggiore di istocompatibilit hla riveste un ruolo di grande rilievo insieme ai recettori transmembrana dell immunit innata come toll like receptor tlrs alle citochine alla cascata del complemento passando per il microbioma intestinale e l epigenetica che si occupa di comprendere fattori che possono modulare l espressione genica senza che vi siano cambiamenti nella sequenza dei nucleotidi l avversomica pu invece essere definita come l applicazione dell immunogenomica e della biologia dei sistemi alla comprensione livello molecolare delle cause genetiche e non poste alla base delle reazioni avverse ai vaccini mirando co prevenirne il rischio di comparsa negli individui nuovi settori della vaccinomica e dell avversomica hanno pioneristicamente avviato la comprensione delle interazioni tra il sistema immunitario ed altri sistemi e tra diversi componenti del sistema immunitario stesso che sono critiche per lo sviluppo della risposta immunitaria ai vaccini e pi generale agli agenti patogeni questi settori studiano la definizione di modelli basati sulla biologia dei sistemi cio su un approccio interdisciplinare grado di integrare dati scientifici big data di diversa natura studiando le connessioni dinamiche esistenti tra geni proteine metaboliti e altre molecole fine di sviluppare un modello esplicativo dei sistemi biologici che aggreghi informazioni utili caratterizzare le risposte innate sia umorali che cellulari gli ambiti di ricerca e lo stato dell arte opportuno sottolineare che attualmente la vaccinologia personalizzata basata su vaccinomica e avversomica pi che mirare alla produzione e allo sviluppo di vaccini destinati singoli individui punta superare il problema della bassa immunogenicit e delle reazioni avverse di specifici vaccini destinati sottogruppi di popolazione ben identificati fondo qualcosa di simile gi accaduto livello internazionale per la vaccinazione antinfluenzale dove negli ultimi anni sono state sviluppate diverse tipologie di vaccini come il trivalente il quadrivalente virus vivo attenuato per pi giovani ricombinante per soggetti allergici alle proteine dell uovo ad alta dose con l adiuvante pi immunogenici ed efficaci ad oggi diversi studi sono stati pubblicati su prestigiose riviste internazionali essi hanno analizzato l influenza delle variazioni genetiche sulla risposta immunitaria di tipo adattivo sia umorale che cellulare indotta dai vaccini contro epatite b rosolia influenza vaiolo antrace e parotite stato dimostrato che circa un terzo della variabilit della risposta umorale vaccino mpr associata polimorfismi dei geni della risposta immune e sottotipi hla inoltre anche polimorfismi dei geni dei recettori tlr influenzano la risposta umorale ai vaccini contro morbillo rosolia e parotite fattori come il sesso l e il peso corporeo solo apparentemente meno complessi da indagare causano estrema variabilit nella risposta immunitaria ai vaccini stata infatti evidenziata una diversa risposta umorale e cellulare base sesso con generale una pi efficace sieroconversione anche una maggiore frequenza di reazioni avverse locali e sistemiche nel sesso femminile queste situazioni sono state evidenziate tutte le fasce escludendo pertanto un ruolo predominante di fattori ormonali ancora poco si conosce su quali fattori genetici possano spiegare queste differenze di risposta immune tra maschi e femmine che fino ad oggi sono state poco considerate negli studi di efficacia e tollerabilit dei vaccini l immunosenescenza pu essere definita come la modifica della funzione immunitaria legata che interessa componenti del sistema immunitario innato ed adattivo determinando una ridotta risposta protettiva ai vaccini e una risposta immunitaria inadeguata alle infezioni meccanismi che sottendono questa ridotta risposta nell anziano non sono ancora pienamente chiari noto tuttavia che presente un alterata secrezione di citochine una minore espressione di tlr una diminuita attivit delle cellule natural killer nk e uno stato di infiammazione cronica con aumento di tnf alfa e sierica gli studi di biologia dei sistemi e di vaccinogenomica insieme con l analisi dei profili citochinici stanno fornendo primo risultati utili prevedere la risposta anticorpale verso il vaccino per l epatite b generale meno efficace nell anziano non per ultimo sovrappeso e obesit rappresentano condizioni predittive di ridotta risposta anticorpale ad esempio ai vaccini per epatite b influenza e tetano tanto da poter forse rappresentare un potenziale marker di immunosoppressione tra le ipotesi poste alla base di questa evenienza viene preso considerazione il meccanismo di resistenza alla leptina tipico degli obesi che sembra condizionare negativamente la risposta immunitaria alla vaccinazione antinfluenzale attraverso una ridotta attivazione di cellule con ridotta produzione di ifn gamma la presente revisione sistematica e meta analisi la prima ad esaminare l intero panorama dei vaccini antinfluenzali prodotti su uova attualmente disponibili italia dalle nostre analisi risulta che nell anziano altamente immunogeno significativamente pi immunogeno rispetto alle formulazioni non adiuvate sia verso ceppi omologhi sia verso ceppi eterovarianti altamente efficace nella prevenzione dei diversi outcome riconducibili influenza influenza confermata laboratorio e le ospedalizzazioni per influenza e le sue complicanze generalmente pi efficace sul campo rispetto alle formulazioni non adiuvate nel prevenire l influenza confermata laboratorio e altri outcome riconducibili influenza sicuro e pu essere co somministrato con vaccini antipneumococcici raccomandati per l anziano e qive attualmente disponibili italia sono altamente immunogeni nei bambino adulti e anziani non inferiori tive per ceppi comune superiori per il quarto ceppo b non condiviso efficaci nella popolazione pediatrica sicuri e co somministrabili con vaccini antipneumococcici e e vaccini contro hz sia vivo attenuato che adiuvato conclusione si evidenzia l importanza della vaccinazione con nella popolazione anziana e con le formulazioni qive nelle popolazioni pi giovani una ulteriore analisi condotta dal food drug administration ha valutato l efficacia delle strategie vaccinali nella popolazione anziana anni nel corso dell ultima stagione influenzale lo studio ha confrontato l efficacia relativa delle varie strategie vaccinali alternative vaccino quadrivalente prodotto modo convenzionale per quanto attiene il vaccino quadrivalente prodotto su culture cellulari ha dimostrato una efficacia relativa pari ci rispetto quadrivalente tradizionale tali risultati indicano l importanza della nuova tecnologia nel prevenire le mutazioni egg adaptive la valutazione di tecnologie sanitarie si rende necessaria nel mercato sanitario fronte del crescente sviluppo tecnologico e una forte spinta innovativit nel contesto di una limitata disponibilit di risorse economiche la rigorosa valutazione critica delle evidenze scientifiche supporto delle nuove tecnologie lo strumento guida fondamentale per le decisioni merito acquisto da questo presupposto si radica l esigenza di diffondere la cultura dell hta intesa come capacit di assessment multidimensionale e multidisciplinare basata sulla letteratura scientifica di alto profilo e sui dati derivanti dalla pratica clinica fine di orientare le decisioni dell acquisto delle tecnologie regione lombardia con la nascita del programma regionale hta dm ha contribuito ad incrementare nelle aziende sanitarie regionali la consapevolezza della necessit di un supporto scientifico alla base delle richieste avanzate e la capacit di svolgimento di una valutazione antecedente l acquisto che tenga considerazione ogni possibile implicazione legata introduzione della tecnologia economica organizzativa etica legale sociale ecc nel contesto locale e regionale l impegno futuro consister nel rafforzare e consolidare gli obiettivi raggiunti capillarizzare la formazione fine di rendere l hta una solida base per le decisioni merito acquisto delle tecnologie ad ogni livello aziendale regionale e nazionale e fornire alle aziende strumenti per la valutazione critica delle evidenze scientifiche fine di realizzare rapporti tecnici consultabili e fruibili questo punto la domanda che dobbiamo porci il personale dei servizi sanitari effettivamente preparato ad agire nell immediato e cosa importante sotto molti punti di vista preparato alla continuit assistenziale derivante nel post emergenza anche livello internazionale possibile reperire nei data base ricerche e studi qualitativi sulle reazioni del personale sanitario situazioni di emergenza alle conseguenze che gli operatori sanitari subiscono nel dover agire determinate situazioni anche per lungo tempo e infine alle competenze che devono essere possedute dal personale sanitario osservando per il panorama formativo italiano ci si accorge che interno dei corsi di laurea sia triennale che specialistica tale situazione non viene nemmeno accennata e tutto si rimanda master di primo di secondo livello relativi alle gestioni immediate dell emergenza e dedicati esclusivamente medici infermieri e psicologi quello che non si ritrova invece una formazione anche solo di base generale di tutti gli altri professionisti sanitari particolare professionisti dell area della prevenzione devono interagire con gli altri operatori sia nell immediato e sia devono poter adattare l erogazione dei servizi situazioni fluide nel post emergenza garantendo l eccesso ai servizi sanitari alle cure e assistenza anche nel momento cui la prima emergenza terminata si una fase di precariet come pu per esempio succedere dopo un terremoto cui le strutture non siano utilizzabili concentrando l attenzione sulle classi di laurea della prevenzione tecnici della prevenzione dei luoghi di lavoro e dell ambiente e assistenti sanitari ci si accorge che nei programmi dei corsi di laurea triennali non sono presenti insegnamenti modulus contenuti che facciano riferimento funzionamento e organizzazione dei servizi sanitari emergenza linee guida che dovrebbero essere conosciute livello di base modo da non creare ulteriori problemi alla popolazione colpita ai volontari che sono coinvolti e alla normativa relativa alle gestioni dell emergenza e della post emergenza inoltre analizzando percorsi formativi sarebbe necessario avere una conoscenza generale della epidemiologia delle conseguenze delle emergenze questa di solito presente solo per quanto riguarda rischi epidemici influenza altre malattie trasmissibili mentre meno presente quella relativa alle conseguenze sulla popolazione e sugli operatori derivanti dalle catastrofi naturali industriali si dovrebbe considerare che il rischio per la popolazione esposta non scompare con il termine dell emergenza si pu protrarre nel tempo basti pensare effetto di una inondazione sulle abitazioni esposizione prolungata polveri alla necessit di vaccinazioni e controlli per periodi di tempo pi meno lunghi questo aggiungiamo il disagio per le persone che devono praticare terapie croniche dialisi chemio immunoterapie ecc ai bambino alle donne gravidanza agli anziani e ai disabili alle persone con altre fragilit da questo si capisce che terminata la prima emergenza che giustamente gestita da personale addetto soccorso e alla cura immediata sarebbe necessario ri organizzare un sistema di assistenza che sia grado di agire di fuori dei soliti schemi organizzativi e che sia composto da personale preparato anche relazionarsi con una popolazione traumatizzata situazioni precarie e ambienti non sempre perfettamente adatti allo scopo seguendo l esempio di altre nazioni si dovrebbero studiare delle competenze di base da aggiungere quelle gi presenti livello curriculare del personale addetto alla prevenzione come assistenti sanitari e tecnici della prevenzione tali competenze dovrebbero preparare professionisti ad adattarsi velocemente organizzazione e alla gestione dei servizi sanitari situazioni di post emergenza nonostante siano gi parte della maggior parte dei corsi di laurea servirebbe aumentare le competenze comunicative e quelle relative alla leadership interno dei servizi per la popolazione la comunicazione di salute infatti riveste un ruolo cruciale per gestire le situazioni critiche ed evitare che si creino situazioni di ulteriore rischio sia per le comunit colpite sia per professionisti e volontari impegnati nelle attivit di soccorso il personale deve essere grado di fornire risposte bisogni assistenziali e no pi meno complessi basti pensare alle difficolt di poter rientrare una abitazione danneggiata da acqua e fango alla difficolt districarsi nella burocrazia per l accesso rimborsi interventi di assistenza economica per chi ha subito talus danni la necessit di far riprendere lavorare le attivit commerciali come quelle legate alla ristorazione che richiedono permessi e controlli da parte delle asl la necessit dei controlli relativi alla dispersione di amianto e co via inoltre considerando che talus professionisti sono per lo pi incardinate nelle strutture dei dipartimenti di prevenzione sarebbe importante studiare e approntare dei programmi di prevenzione primaria secondaria e terziaria da attivare ad hoc oltre tutte le attivit di promozione della salute rivolte non solo ai singoli soprattutto alle comunit colpite affinch possano riprendersi nel pi breve tempo possibile e diminuiscano gli effetti negativi legati evento quindi cosa si pu effettivamente fare concreto le soluzioni possibili sono diverse tutte richiedono uno sforzo organizzativo da parte soprattutto delle universit e delle aziende sanitarie sarebbe necessario stilare un elenco di competenze specifiche per professionisti dell area della prevenzione sia emergenza che post emergenza integrare livello curriculare nella formazione universitaria queste competenze attivare dei percorsi specialistici master di primo e secondo livello appositi per le professioni della prevenzione per il management sanitario delle post emergenze che possano affiancarsi quelli di medici e infermieri modo da rendere il sistema adatto alle necessit della popolazione inoltre interno dei dipartimenti di prevenzione sarebbe necessario organizzare eventi formativi ad hoc legati alle tecniche di promozione della salute post emergenza dal ad oggi la metodologia adottata ha previsto occasioni di incontro con cittadini associazioni e operatori e momenti di valutazione della qualit percepita attraverso la somministrazione di questionari rivolti agli utenti l analisi di segnalazioni pervenute ufficio relazioni con il pubblico urp sono stati inoltre svolti percorsi di certificazione del pdta mammella cermet e della breast unit european society breast cancer specialists eusoma tali azioni hanno individuato delle criticit e dato seguito ad interventi orientati miglioramento di accessibilit appropriatezza ed equit caratteristiche che contribuiscono aumento della fiducia da parte del cittadino relativamente accessibilit emerso che numerose donne avevano difficolt nel contattare il numero verde stato perci creato il portale line per lo screening mammografico che consente alla donna di modificare autonomia luogo data e os dell appuntamento per lo screening della cervice l accesso ai consultori stato differenziato prevedendo alcune sedi libero accesso ed altre con appuntamento si sta sperimentando inoltre l offerta congiunta della vaccinazione hpv e l effettuazione del pap test di screening alle enni per quanto riguarda invece lo screening del colon retto seguito alla valutazione della copertura dei punti di consegna del kit del sangue occulto fecale fit si deciso di incrementarne il numero nelle zone scoperte la garanzia del rispetto dei tempo di chiamata ii livello colonscopia che influenza maniera importante l abbandono del percorso stata ottenuta tramite l istituzione di una colon unit inoltre stato sottoposto un questionario agli utenti che avevano ritirato il kit per l esecuzione del fit senza eseguirlo fine di indagare motivi di mancata adesione e sollecitare la partecipazione infine stata garantita la possibilit di esecuzione dei test di screening nella popolazione detenuta per implementare l appropriatezza si tentato di limitare rischi di sovra sottoutilizzo delle indagini costruendo report specifici per medici di medicina generale riguardo la copertura screening extra screening dei loro assistiti e applicando le indicazioni regionali per garantire equit infine stato messo atto un percorso di health equity audit hea sia sul pdta della mammella il quale seguito focus sulle caratteristiche socio demografiche delle donne mai aderenti ha portato mantenimento del mezzo mobile per garantire l adeguata copertura del territorio che sul pdta del colon retto che ha evidenziato una scarsa adesione negli uomini e nei cittadini stranieri per cui sono stati implementati incontri di sensibilizzazione e informazione rivolti alla popolazione immigrata e sono stati distribuiti opuscoli lingue diverse per incentivarla alla partecipazione sono stati infine elaborati ed offerti attivamente altri tipi di opuscoli informativi rivolti alle donne con neoplasie seno che illustrano il percorso di diagnosi e cura e che descrivono diritti delle donne operate la realizzazione dell ambizioso obiettivo internazionale nel contesto regionale ha previsto il coinvolgimento diretto di rappresentanti delle aziende sanitarie lombarde attraverso l istituzione di una commissione per le tecnologie emergenti cte e di una commissione per le tecnologie diffusione diffuse ed obsolete ctd con attivit distinte per le segnalazioni di tecnologie sanitarie con la produzione di un giudizio di priorit tramite analisi decisionale criteri multipli multi criterion decision analysis mcda e per dossier informativi di valutazione di tecnologie sanitarie con l identificazione di referenti per l assessment tecnico e di un asst irccs lombardo cui affidare la realizzazione di un rapporto di hta e con la realizzazione di un giudizio di

ospedaliero per ottenere un corretto ranking del rischio delle strutture rispetto indicatore di esito prescelto secondo un approccio di risk adjustment che consideri le diverse caratteristiche degli utenti e delle udo esame si adottato il modello multilevel fine di considerare la possibile correlazione esistente tra gli utenti appartenenti alla stessa struttura la scelta delle variabili da inserire nel modello ha cercato di identificare dei predittori che riuscissero intercettare lo stato di salute del paziente e nello stesso tempo standardizzare le condizioni dovute sesso alla durata del ricovero la profilassi adottata epoca per l influenza si basava su principi fondamentali mezzi per interrompere la trasmissione aerea mezzi per inibire la fissazione del virus alle cellule dell ospite mezzi per agire sui germi responsabili delle complicanze respiratorie vaccinazione antinfluenzale genova la profilassi dell influenza fu attuata un ufficio con impiegati utilizzando un innovativo preparato chimico del gruppo delle aldeidi coperte la diossimetilcarbamide tale preparato venne usato come metodo profilattico perch causava variazioni di carica elettrica fra gruppi aminici delle proteine bacillari gruppi carbossilici ed enzimi microbici che permettevano aldeide di sottrarre gli enzimi ossidanti che intervengono nei processi di riproduzione e sviluppo dei microrganismi la profilassi iniziata dopo l insorgenza dei sintomi due soggetti prevedeva compresse da gr die da sciogliere bocca per un periodo di giorni e fu somministrata tutti gli impiegati tale

indagine stata effettuata attraverso la somministrazione di un questionario online anonimo inviato tramite posta elettronica ad un campione casuale di farmacisti selezionati su tutto il territorio nazionale il questionario mirava alla raccolta di informazioni relative ai dati socio anagrafici e professionali conoscenze relative alla prescrizione di farmaci antibiotici e ai fattori predisponenti lo sviluppo di abr attitudini sul ruolo del farmacista nel contenimento del fenomeno dell abr comportamenti relativi erogazione di antibiotici senza prescrizione risultati sono stati esaminati questionari del centro del nord e del sud italia il dei farmacisti ha affermato di aver almeno una volta erogato antibiotici senza prescrizione nonostante questo dei farmacisti conoscenza che la somministrazione di antibiotici senza ricetta non consentita dalla legge il dei farmacisti ha anche affermato che rifiutare l erogazione dell antibiotico spinge il cliente rivolgersi ad un altra farmacia le condizioni cliniche per le quali pi comunemente l antibiotico viene erogato senza prescrizione includono il mal di denti l otalgia le malattie cutanee le patologie gastrointestinali la sindrome influenzale raffreddore le motivazioni che maggiormente spingono il farmacista ad erogare un antibiotico assenza di prescrizione sono la successiva presentazione della ricetta da parte del cliente la conoscenza personale del cliente dei farmacisti ritiene che la pratica dell erogazione di antibiotici senza prescrizione contribuisca fortemente allo sviluppo di abr e ritiene che tale pratica contribuisca utilizzo improprio di antibiotici da parte dei clienti infine la quasi totalit dei partecipanti allo studio concorda che farmacisti dovrebbero avere un ruolo attivo ed effettivo

nel campo della salute union action field health e grazie ad un finanziamento europeo stato esteso anche altre nazioni anche la politica italiana ha investito nel progetto e la senetrice sonia fregolent con il testo ddl leg lo ha presentato alla commissione permanente igiene e sanit con lo scopo di estenderlo tutto il territorio nazionale le attivit dello screening almeno per quanto riguarda la regione del veneto si sono mantenute pi meno costanti nel corso di questo decennio coinvolgendo modo attivo la figura degli assistenti sanitari che hanno dimostrato di avere un ruolo chiave nello screening stesso purtroppo per problemi di tipo organizzativo dopo l introduzione della legge lorenzin per quanto riguarda l obbligatoriet vaccinale parte del personale dedicato allo screening si dovuto impegnare nel recupero dei non vaccinati e per un certo periodo anche le attivit dello screening cardiovascolare hanno avuto dei rallentamenti mentre alcune regioni una volta terminato l innesco finanziario del progetto ccm il cardio non stato implementato altre si manifestato l interesse anche senza fianziamenti aggiuntivi di avviarlo dalla sua attivazione dapprima forma di progetto pilota e successivamente con finanziamento ccm ministero della salute lo screning cardiovascolare ha permesso nei dipartimenti di prevenzione cui si sviluppato di creare ravvivare percorsi di salute riguardante tre principali fattori di rischio tabagismo inattivit fisica alimentazione scorretta inoltre alcuni casi ha portato apertura di collaborazioni con societ enti associazioni presenti nel territorio che talvolta erano sconosciute anche alla popolazione generale da una stima conclusiva del progetto per alcuni percorsi di salute non hanno riscontrato una buona adesione da parte dei soggetti screenati sopratttutto per quanto riguarda la disassuefazione dal fumo di sigaretta infatti molti dei fumatori che erano intenzionati smettere hanno deciso di farlo autonomamente invece corsi per l alimentazione e per l attivit fisica hanno riscontrato un discreto sucesso dati rilevati nel corso degli anni hanno dimostrato che mentre per alcuni parametri valori si sono mantenuti pi meno costanti e sospetti nuovi iperglicemici soggetti sovrap peso per altri sono migliorati riduzione del numero di soggetti dediti tabagismo peggiorati come ad esempio gli ipertesi questo dato che praticamente raddoppiato nel corso di questo decennio deve farci riflettere sulle azioni da intraprendere anche partire dall pi precoci quanto gli ipertesi cinquatenni sono una quota ragguardevole sebbene lo screening abbia dimostrato con l elevato numero di arruolati ed adesioni alcune aulss si sfiorato anche il di adesione e successivamente con le visite di follow che nel breve termine vi sia stato un miglioramento degli stili di vita alterati e dei parametri glicemia ipertensione ipercolesterolemia non nella norma manca ancora un analisi di esito sul lungo periodo questa criticit non ancora risolta per la mancanza di una partership con le universit italiane sicuramente necessaria per avere una maggiore robustezza dei risultati ottenuti infatti lo screening cardiovascolare risulta essere uno dei pi grandi e longevi programmi di prevenzione cardiovascolare alla fine di questo decennio di attivit le criticit pi importanti che si sono rilevate sono legate pi problemi di tipo amministrativo e di riorganizzazione interna alle asl che non nello svolgimento dello screening stesso che ha dimostrato essere uno strumento valido per la prevenzione delle mcv riconosciuto ormai anche livello internazionale lo scopo quindi del prossimo futuro di far diventare il cardio un attivit di sistema interno dei dipartimenti di prevenzione andando ad affiancare gli altri screening oncologici bibliografia di riferimento ccmr regione del veneto progetto ccm attivazione di un progetto di prevenzione cardiovascolare primaria sul modello dei programmi di screening oncologico iv screening la relazione fra ambiente e malattie cardiovascolari stata messa pi evidenza da numerosi studi nell ultimo decennio fra determinanti della patologia cardiovascolare importanti fattori modificabili sono gli stili di vita fumo dieta alcool movimento stress ecc e l inquinamento ambientale sebbene l aria pulita sia considerata un requisito fondamentale per il mantenimento della salute umana l inquinamento atmosferico continuum rappresentare una grave minaccia per la salute sia nei paesi sviluppati che quelli via di sviluppo lo sviluppo delle conoscenze epigenetiche ha permesso di rilevare come la metilazione del dna le modifiche degli istoni e l espressione dei microrna possano cambiare le funzioni dei geni sotto influenza di fattori esogeni studi recenti mostrano che le alterazioni epigenetiche mediano la tossicit da sostanze chimiche ambientali e sono ereditabili particolare metalli pesanti come cadmio arsenico nichel cromo mercurio e piombo composti organici clorurati come pesticidi clorurati il tricloroetilene gli acidi cloroacetici proliferatori di perossisomi gli inquinanti atmosferici particolato black carbon benzene ossidi di zolfo e di azoto ecc e gli interferenti endocrini bisfenolo inquinanti organici persistenti diossina composti estrogeno simili ecc stato dimostrato che gli inquinanti chimici possono procurare alterazioni epigenetiche uguali simili quelle che si rilevano pazienti tessuti malati sono necessarie ulteriori indag ini per determinare se gli individui esposti sviluppino alterazioni epigenetiche nel tempo quali alterazioni aumentino il rischio di malattia e se talus alterazioni vengano trasmesse livello transgenerazionale tra fattori ambientali indagati per la relazione con le malattie cardiovascolari quelli legati inquinamento dell aria indoor e outdoor sembrano avere un ruolo maggiore le variazioni della temperatura dell aria hanno una forte influenza sull aumento della mortalit cardiovascolare caratterizzata da una relazione simil v guidata da un aumento del tono simpatico inoltre cambiamenti dinamici della temperatura sono probabilmente pi importanti del livello assoluto di temperatura principali inquinanti indoor associati con l aumento della mortalit e morbosit cardiovascolare sono il fumo proveniente dalle combustioni da riscaldamento e da cottura e il fumo di tabacco ambientale ets l ets non ha dose soglia e mostra una relazione doseeffetto curvilinea con effetti significativi anche basse dosi sia mediante stimolo nicotinico sul sistema simpatico che mediante stress ossidativo vascolare si osservato che vietando il fumo ambienti indoor si riscontrava una diminuzione degli eventi cardiovascolari riguardo inquinamento outdoor l inalazione la principale via di esposizione breve termine anidride solforosa che influisce negativamente sulla salute umana un nostro studio ha stimato gli effetti sulla salute dell esposizione breve termine alla khorramabad iran utilizzando il software airq sviluppato dall organizzazione mondiale della sanit oms le concentrazioni medie giornaliere di sono state utilizzate come stime dell esposizione umana breve termine e consentono il calcolo del rischio relativo eccesso attribuibile infarto miocardico acuto im e ai ricoveri ospedalieri dovuti broncopneumopatia cronica ostruttiva bpco per un aumento di g di abbiamo rilevato un rischio del pi per im e del pi di bpco poich le caratteristiche geografiche demografiche e climatiche europa sono diverse dalle aree cui le relazioni di rischio sono state sviluppate saranno necessarie ulteriori indagini per quantificare completamente gli altri impatti sulla salute un rischio ridotto di mi e bpco attribuibile potrebbe essere raggiunto se fossero implementate strategie e misure di mitigazione per ridurre l esposizione un altro nostro studio insieme ai colleghi iraniani ha cercato di valutare sempre usando airq possibili effetti del particolato proveniente dagli eventi di polvere mediorientale med nell aria khorramabad iran sulla salute umana particolare sono stati stimati ricoveri ospedalieri per le malattie cardiovascolari e per le malattie respiratorie nel periodo il numero di casi eccesso di malattia cardiovascolare era e nei giorni di evento normale polveroso e med rispettivamente il numero pi alto di ricoveri ospedalieri stato stimato per concentrazioni di nell intervallo da g ovvero inferiore valore limite giornaliero g stabilito dall oms il di malattie cardiovascolari sono stati attribuiti concentrazioni di superiori g lo studio dimostra un impatto significativo dell inquinamento atmosferico sulle persone l impiego di barriere di verde e l irrigazione di aree asciutte permetterebbe di controllare gli impatti delle tempeste di polvere sulla salute dei residenti recentemente stato molto valutato l aumento della mortalit per patologie cardiovascolari seguito esposizione lungo termine inquinamento da particolato atmosferico e l aumento del rischio di infarto ictus e insufficienza cardiaca per aumento breve termine dell inquinamento atmosferico tali effetti pare siano mediati da una reazione sistemica allo stress ossidativo vascolare seguita da disfunzione endoteliale attivazione dei monociti e da alcuni cambiamenti proaterogenici delle lipoproteine inoltre l inquinamento atmosferico favorisce la formazione di trombi causa dell aumento dei fattori di coagulazione e dell attivazione piastrinica aumentado co il rischio di tromboembolia venosa gli effetti negativi sulla salute sembrano derivare dai metalli trasportati dal sangue e dai metalli derivanti dall esposizione particolato che attraverso polmoni passano nel cuore e nel flusso sanguigno metalli possono avere un effetto dannoso sia sulle cellule del sangue particolare le piastrine che sulla circolazione alcune evidenze dimostrano le conseguenze aterotrombotiche dell esposizione acuta e cronica inquinamento atmosferico pochi studi hanno esaminato gli effetti dell esposizione sui biomarcatori protrombotici che portano alla tromboembolia venosa una nostra revisione sistematica degli ultimi dodici anni mirata verificare la relazione tra esposizione ai metalli inalabili e disturbi di biomarcatori coagulativi che portano alle tromboembolie venose degli arti inferiori ad esempio trombosi venosa profonda supportano l ipotesi che l esposizione ai metalli inalabili come composti elementali nel materiale particolato causi cambiamenti attivazione di numerosi biomarcatori emostatici protrombotici umani il tromboembolismo venoso primario tev meno frequente di altri eventi trombotici tuttavia sia l embolia polmonare ep che la trombosi venosa profonda tvp sono sempre frequenti molti fattori di rischio possono determinare il tev particolare il particolato fine e ultrafine pm dell aria atmosferica come pm pm pm e il tempo di esposizione diversi studi epidemiologici l hanno evidenziato senza essere ancora riusciti dimostrare il peso effettivo dell associazione e reali meccanismi bisogna inoltre sottolineare che le variazioni climatiche stagionali costituiscono un fattore di rischio efficace per la comparsa di tev tvp per identificare il rischio di trombosi venosa profonda tvp abbiamo effettuato uno su pazienti allo scopo di valutare il potenziale degli esami del sangue di routine test inclusi un sistema modello di stratificazione del rischio di tvp sono stati il tasso di sedimentazione eritrocitaria l antitrombina iii la proteina c reattiva il dimero e il peptide natriuretico pro cervello terminale il sistema di stratificazione del rischio tvp risultato moderatamente prognostico il tasso medio di ospedalizzazione da hz rilevato linea rispetto alla letteratura per mentre il tasso medio di accesso pronto soccorso inferiore cos si stima un numero di accessi medico di medicina generale per hz di circa pazienti anno per ridurre tale burden di patologia appare necessario implementare le attuali scarse coperture vaccinali regione sicilia l intervento valutativo del servizio socio sanitario integrato permette di identificare precocemente soggetti ad elevato rischio di caduta e fattori ad esso maggiormente connessi la stratificazione del rischio rappresenta la base per interventi di prevenzione che riducendo l incidenza dell evento caduta possono migliorare la qualit della vita dei soggetti intervistati e presumibilmente riducono l uso dei servizi di diagnosi e cura indagini prospettiche sono necessarie verificare il realizzarsi di talus benefici livello individuale di popolazione e di uso dei servizi un altro studio abbiamo misurato il rame cu lo zinco zn e il manganese mn cruciali per il normale mantenimento della fisiologia umana e livelli di piombo pb rappresentativi del livello di inquinamento ambientale soggetti che soffrono di trombosi venosa profonda degli arti inferiori tvp v soggetti sani inoltre si determinato lo stress ossidativo dosando le sostanze reattive dell acido tiobarbiturico tbars e la somma di malondialdeide mda e e la concentrazione di superossido dismutasi cu zn sod entrambi gruppi sono state rilevate basse concentrazioni di zn mn e cu rispetto ad alte concentrazioni di pb nei soggetti con tvp tbars sono stati trovati pi alti nel gruppo dei casi contrario le concentrazioni di sod sono state trovate pi basse nei casi rispetto ai controlli inoltre abbiamo trovato la dieta dei soggetti patologici significativamente carente nell introduzione di verdure questi risultati sono indicativi di una minore attivit enzimatica nei pazienti correlata basso livelli di metalli di transizione nei tvp e alti livelli di pb associati una dieta squilibrata la malattia tromboembolica un disturbo complesso con un eziologia multifattoriale che colpisce gravemente sebbene maniera diversa anche neonati e bambino dove spesso viene diagnosticata ritardo peggiorando la prognosi sulla malattia neonatale sono disponibili scarsi dati epidemiologici e pochi studi clinici randomizzati su pazienti pediatrici e le raccomandazioni terapeutiche si basano gran parte su linee guida per adulti pertanto talus pazienti soffriranno per diversi decenni delle complicanze della trombosi e del rischio di un nuovo episodio trombotico una nostra review sulla malattia tromboembolica neonatale e sulla sua prevenzione abbiamo valutato fattori che influiscono sulla madre sul feto e sul neonato considerando gli aspetti farmacologici l ambiente lo stile di vita e il lavoro la revisione ha evidenziato un urgente necessit di migliorare le strategie preventive diagnostiche e terapeutiche per una diminuzione degli esiti sui pazienti ancora oggi nonostante qualche esempio direzione contraria sistemi sanitari pagano per volume di attivit piuttosto che per valore e noi otteniamo quello per cui paghiamo pi esami pi procedure interventistiche pi visite tuttavia gli elementi che caratterizzano il valore nell assistenza sanitarium sono il disegno organizzativo il processo il costo del processo nel tempo nel settore della produzione industriale e della business intelligence gli elementi che hanno consentito di operare il cambiamento dal volume di prestazioni valore sono stati standardizzazione misurazione reporting il riportare pubblicamente dei dati sulla performance e sugli esiti

ruolo del medico di sanit pubblica il neo specialista di sanit pubblica grado di affrontare le nuove esigenze di un sistema salute che evolve la scuola di specializzazione igiene e medicina preventiva il luogo capace di stimolare la crescita del medico formazione specialistica offrendogli metodologie e strumenti che lo rendano grado di rispondere queste nuove sfide il giovane medico di sanit pubblica disposto mettere discussione la propria professione questo workshop come consulta dei medici formazione specialistica ci proponiamo di analizzare le prospettive delle discipline della sanit pubblica confrontandole con le abilit ac quisite durante l attuale formazione specialistica e individuando le possibili core competence che dovremmo sviluppare per interpretare le sfide future un mondo che corre oltre il domani quest ottica abbiamo pertanto deciso di sviluppare e proporre le quattro relazioni seguenti tra loro logicamente e trasversalmente legate dal bisogno di salute alla risposta della sanit come chiudere il cerchio le trasformazioni sociali demografiche ed epidemiologiche avvenute negli ultimi decenni hanno portato ad un progressivo mutamento dei bisogni di salute della popolazione e rischiano di minare la sostenibilit e principi di universalismo del sistema sanitario infatti l invecchiamento della popolazione e l epidemia di malattie croniche sono alla base dell aumentata complessit dei bisogni assistenziali e l allargamento della forbice delle disuguaglianze sociali esitato nuove forme di marginalit e povert non solo materiale anche relazionale e culturale ci si associa una societ che diventa progressivamente sempre pi multietnica e multiculturale frutto di un processo migratorio costante e strutturale di questo tempo connections data related

di acque superficiali e potabili trattate con differenti metodologie di disinfezione per la gestione del rischio idropotabile l approvvigionamento idropotabile della sardegna mostra da tempo alcune criticit carenza di disponibilit di acque profonde conseguente maggiore impiego di acque superficiali condizione di eutrofia pi evidente alcuni laghi elevata percentuale di acque potabilizzate difficolt di potabilizzazione la pi elevata percentuale tra le regioni italiane merito alla dispersione di acqua rete e sfiducia nel bere acqua di rubinetto inoltre non infrequente il riscontro di disinfection products dbps potenzialmente dannosi per la salute fine di ridurre la presenza di talus composti nell arco degli anni vari impianti sono state adottate differenti metodiche di disinfezione passando dall ipoclorito di sodio biossido di cloro come disinfettante primario da solo successivamente associato alla monocloramina come disinfettante secondario tale articolato contesto anche sulla base degli esiti di ricerche condotte altri ambiti geografici che hanno evidenziato la presenza di sostanze mutageno cancerogene provenienti sia dal corpo idrico di attingimento sia dagli stessi sistemi di disinfezione nonch per il passaggio dell acqua potabile nella rete idrica lo scopo dello studio stato quello di valutare la presenza e la formazione di sostanze genotossiche acque provenienti da acquedotti della sardegna centro settentrionale tre successive tappe della potabilizzazione anche per poter fornire gestore idrico informazioni utili per migliorare la qualit dell acqua pertanto acque grezze disinfettate e distribuite rete circa abitanti dopo una preliminare caratterizzazione chimica e microbiologica sono state sottoposte differenti test su acqua tal quale test dei micronuclei e delle aberrazioni cromosomiche radici di allium cepa e su acqua concentrata mediante adsorbimento fase solida con cartucce di silice test della microgelelettroforesi singola cellula test della cometa test dei micronuclei su cellule di epatocarcinoma umano vitro e test di ames su ceppi e di salmonella typhimurium risultati ottenuti attraverso test di genotossicit mutagenicit hanno evidenziato presenza di xenobiotici nelle acque grezze disinfettate e distribuite rete provenienti dai quattro laghi oggetto di indagine il comet test ha mostrato il maggior numero di risultati positivi accordo con il test di ames e con il test allium l uso di cloramine associate ad altri disinfettanti non ha eliminato la mutagenicit riscontrata nell acqua grezza e quando l acqua grezza non era mutagena ha introdotto sostanze mutagene genotossiche si evidenzia pertanto la necessit di effettuare ulteriori indagini di valutazione del rischio e di adottare interventi di prevenzione finalizzati migliorare la qualit dell acqua di questi bacini per ridurre rischi per la salute associati alla mutagenicit dell acqua potabile nel tutte le linee guida nazionali per la prevenzione e il controllo della legionellosi sono state incorporate un unico documento aggiornato consultabile sul sito istituzionale del ministero allegato pdf rivolto alle strutture turistico ricettive sanitarie e termali le linee guida riportano la valutazione del rischio come una delle misure di prevenzione pi efficaci per la gestione della contaminazione da legionella nei sistemi idrici secondo l articolazione delle competenze sancita seguito della riforma del titolo v della costituzione si ritiene che le linee guida nazionali debbano contenere indirizzi criteri e indicazioni generali che compete alle regioni tradurre specifiche linee di intervento ambito territoriale le regioni dunque recepiscono le linee guida nazionali e toscana veneto sicilia integrandole e aggiornandole con linee guida regionali e puglia le linee guida regionali pongono rilievo che la prevenzione delle infezioni da legionella basata essenzialmente sull attivo controllo e sulla corretta manutenzione degli impianti che possono essere pi frequentemente sede di contaminazione da parte del microrganismo controlli effettuati dalle aziende sanitarie locali su strutture sanitarie e sociosanitarie prevedono verifiche scadenzate e base agli esiti riscontrati si adottano provvedimenti previsti dalla normativa regionale la regione puglia con la dgr del novembre b u del maggio ha attivato un sistema per la sorveglianza e il controllo della legionellosi che nell arco di anni ha prodotto la stesura di indirizzi operativi sia per la prevenzione e il controllo della legionellosi nelle strutture turistico ricettive e ad uso collettivo b u del giugno sia per la sorveglianza clinica e ambientale della legionellosi nelle strutture sanitarie ed assistenziali b u del agosto comprese attivit di formazione informazione e comunicazione del rischio il febbraio alla luce di quanto ritenuto dall organizzazione mondiale della sanit per cui tra tutti patogeni presenti nell acqua legionella causa il maggiore onere sotto il profilo sanitario nell unione europea la commissione europea bruxelles ha adottato la proposta di rifusione della direttiva del parlamento europeo e del consiglio concernente la qualit delle acque destinate consumo umano la proposta di rifusione si prefigge di aggiornare gli standard qualitativi dell acqua includendo legionella tra microrganismi da ricercare introdurre un approccio basato sul rischio per il controllo dell acqua migliorare le informazioni sulla qualit dell acqua e sui servizi idrici per consumatori armonizzare le norme relative ai prodotti contatto con l acqua potabile e migliorare l accesso acqua successivamente tale proposta ha subito alcuni aggiornamenti febbraio bruxelles che hanno riguardato tra le diverse modifiche alla direttiva europea anche il valore di parametro di legionella pari ufc l tale valore non definito come obiettivo terminus di salute come valore soglia che pu far scattare una valutazione del rischio e provvedimenti correttivi tali azioni potrebbero essere prese considerazione anche di sotto del valore di parametro ad esempio caso di infezioni e focolai questi casi va confermata la fonte dell infezione e identificata la specie cui appartiene la proposta di rifusione riprende il concetto del piano di sicurezza dell acqua water safety plan wsp un sistema globale di valutazione e gestione del rischio esteso ciascuna fase della filiera idrica per garantire la protezione delle risorse idriche e la riduzione di potenziali pericoli per la salute umana tale lo scetticismo nei confronti delle vaccinazioni un fenomeno crescita che ha compromesso le coperture vaccinali molti paesi ad alto reddito inclusa l italia registrato negli anni successivi con differente tempistica nei diversi territori italiani grado di coinvolgere inizialmente alcune regioni e di diffondersi successivamente come una vera e propria ondata epidemica questo fenomeno ampiamente studiato dalla stessa oms stato denominato esitazione vaccinale vaccine hesitancy ed stato definito come il ritardo nella accettazione il rifiuto delle vaccinazioni nonostante la disponibilit di servizi vaccinali la vaccine hesitancy un fenomeno complesso e contesto specifico che varia nel tempo nel luogo e per tipologia di vaccino influenzata da fattori quali la compiacenza la convenienza e la fiducia l oms ha inoltre studiato fattori grado di determinare la scelta di vaccinare e le strategie percorribili per ottenere un miglioramento dell accettazione delle vaccinazioni e un relativo aumento delle coperture vaccinali tra questi spiccano alcuni determinanti che riguardano il contesto comunicativo la copertura massmediatica di certe notizie collegate ai vaccini l attitudine giornalistica con cui talus notizie sono presentate il ruolo degli operatori sanitari nel raccomandare le vaccinazioni modo corretto e la coerenza delle raccomandazioni le esperienze personali e la conoscenza di amici e familiari che raccontano storie di verosimili danni da vaccino questi elementi vanno ad incidere maniera impattante non definitiva sui processi mentali e decisionali di ciascun genitore ultima analisi le convinzioni e le attitudini verso la salute e la prevenzione la percezione soggettiva dei rischi e dei benefici lo spazio alle teorie cospirazioniste la percezione negativa relativa ruolo delle industrie farmaceutiche e molti altri determinanti di contesto ed individuali sono condizionati dalle euristiche e dai bias cognitivi che cablano il cervello di ciascun genitore e le neuroscienze cognitive sono sempre pi grado di offrire strumenti potenti e predittivi per spiegare meccanismi mentali che impediscono di fare scelte razionali di fronte questo scenario comprendiamo la complessit del fenomeno esitazione vaccinale che pu essere letto dal punto di vista epidemiologico con dei semplici indicatori di sintesi quali le stesse coperture vaccinali che dovrebbe essere affrontato centralmente e localmente con percorsi ed approcci multipli differenziati continuativi e rispettosi delle svariate forme di esitazione che caratterizzano genitori italiani quando sul finire del tre morti risultarono associate temporalmente alla somministrazione dello stesso vaccino antinfluenzale aifa dispose cautelativamente il divieto di utilizzo di due lotti di vaccino contempo pubblic un comunicato stampa cui riportava la notizia che venne ripresa da tutte le testate giornalistiche italiane tempo la predominanza delle informazioni collegate ai vaccini era di segno negativo l argomento vaccinale veniva affrontato non senza commettere marcati errori giornalistici come il reiterato errore di falce balance erratum par condicio negli anni compresi tra il e il si sono intensificati sul territorio italiano incontri pubblici promossi da organizzazioni contrarie alla pratica vaccinale risultati delle indagini biennali condotte da censis ucsi sulla comunicazione italia hanno messo evidenziano un sempre pi marcato utilizzo di internet nella ricerca di informazioni attraverso motori di ricerca siti web testate giornalistiche e principali social network facebook tra tutti si conferma una delle principali fonti informative specialmente tra pi giovani la qualit delle informazioni presenti sul web non sempre garantita e da molti anni questa parte movimenti oppositori alle vaccinazioni sfruttano la rete per diffondere disinformazione un indagine riporta che il dei genitori decide di non vaccinare propri figli sulla base delle informazioni reperite su internet ulteriori indagini hanno messo evidenza l incremento esponenziale del numero degli articoli pubblicati sulla tematica vaccinale secondo dati observa relativi alle principali testate giornalistiche nazionali si passati da articoli nel nel nel frattempo influencer e opinion leader si sono affermati sulla scena nazionale e hanno avuto il merito di dare rilevanza ad una corretta informazione ambito vaccinale tra pi appassionati sostenitori della scienza e delle vaccinazioni emerso il prof roberto burioni professore ordinario universit san raffaele di milano e noto per suoi interventi sui social medium contro la disinformazione ambito vaccinale la sua pagina facebook ha oltre follower e la sua opera di divulgazione si rafforzata con la pubblicazione di libri dall indiscusso successo il cambio di passo nei confronti delle vaccinazioni stato generale e nel biennio molte situazioni sono cambiate maniera radicale le principali organizzazioni e societ scientifiche tra le quali la societ italiana di igiene medicina preventiva e sanit pubblica siti hanno sollevato le proprie voci spesso con comunicati congiunti per affermare il primato delle vaccinazioni e difendere la pratica vaccinale ogni occasione necessaria gli ordini dei medici hanno preso una ferma posizione nei confronti di medici che hanno fatto del proprio scetticismo sui vaccini una bandiera alcuni di questi medici sono stati radiati sospesi dal proprio ordine di appartenenza il giornalismo italiano lo stesso identico giornalismo sensazionalista di sempre nel giro di pochi anni le prime pagine dei nostri quotidiani hanno visto la transizione dei messaggi comunicativi si passati dal vaccino killer alla meningite killer con le stesse modalit giornalistiche e con gli stessi risultati nel le notizie sui casi di meningite toscana hanno spaventato e ingenerato un impropria richiesta di vaccinazioni sul versante dei siti web degno di nota l impegno della siti attraverso il portale vaccinars nato nel allo scopo di contrastare la disinformazione imperante nel web materia di vaccinazioni grazie apporto specialistico della siti pochi anni vaccinars diventato il punto di riferimento di migliaia di operatori sanitari e di famiglie raggiungendo milioni di utenti unici e ponendo le basi per avere sempre maggiore visibilit vista la recente messa rete di nuovi portali vaccinali regionali accomunati dal nome vaccinarsi lo scenario comunicativo completamente cambiato anche nei principali social network nel nasce riv rete informazione vaccini principalmente come pagina facebook riv ha quasi follower e si occupa esclusivamente di informazione vaccinale nel nasce io vaccino e nel rappresenta la pagina facebook interamente dedicata alla promozione delle vaccinazioni di pi grande successo con oltre follower nel frattempo cambium radicalmente lo scenario politico il governo nazionale nel maggio ha pubblicato il decreto legge convertito successivamente legge legge ampliando co il numero delle vaccinazioni obbligatorie da e sanzionando le mancate vaccinazioni con multe per la fascia anni e sospensioni scolastiche per bambino di inferiore ai anni questo repentino e sostanziale cambiamento del contesto politico ha generato un articolato dibattito con ampia copertura mediatica il recupero di un gran numero di inadempienze vaccinali e la radicalizzazione di posizioni estreme con genitori precedentemente esitanti che hanno risolto consolidato propri dubbi e le proprie perplessit sulle vaccinazioni ad ogni livello nazionale regionale e locale possono essere messe campo azioni finalizzate contrastare l esitazione vaccinale dapprima studiandone le peculiarit le caratteristiche che la distinguono da territorio territorio e da vaccino vaccino l approccio oms stato teorizzato attraverso la cosiddetta guida tip tailoring immunization programmes con l obiettivo di facilitare la definizione e l adozione di interventi strategici per la programmazione e la comunicazione sulle vaccinazioni l obiettivo generale della guida alla realizzazione di programmi di immunizzazione su misura quello di fornire validi metodi e strumenti che possano aiutare programmi nazionali di immunizzazione ad elaborare strategie specifiche per incrementare l adesione alle vaccinazioni di neonati e bambino aumentando co le coperture vaccinali la guida tip utilizza un metodo di segmentazione che aiuta ad individuare gruppi di popolazione suscettibili cui rivolgere prioritariamente propri sforzi la guida utilizza percorsi e mappe concettuali per conoscere nel dettaglio da che cosa sono guidate le decisioni dei genitori ed esplorare il ruolo degli operatori delle vaccinazioni nell influenzare le scelte e le azioni degli stessi genitori sull immunizzazione fornisce inoltre assistenza per definire implementare monitorare e valutare interventi basati sui risultati del processo di segmentazione e di analisi dei profili e un repertorio di buone pratiche dei programmi di immunizzazione cui possono attingere gli estensori dei programmi di immunizzazione se questo approccio sistematico lontano dall essere applicato italia allora opportuno che gli sforzi vengano attuati livello locale questo senso le asl e particolare servizi vaccinali locali possono adottare strategie applicabili e percorribili co da partecipare senso positivo miglioramento dello scenario comunicativo complessivo di seguito si riportano obiettivi perseguibili livello locale attenzione fenomeno esitazione vaccinale alla base di ogni approccio di risposta fenomeno hesitancy deve esserci una attenta valutazione epidemiologica che potr fare tesoro di indagini specifiche dalle survey analisi dettagliata delle coperture vaccinali necessario questo proposito potersi affidare ad un livello di informatizzazione tale da rendere semplice e non time consuming l analisi delle coperture con approfondimenti e analisi specifiche per luogo tipologia di vaccino sede vaccinale erogazione e pediatra di riferimento gli operatori dedicati alle vaccinazioni quelli coinvolti come gli stessi pediatri di libera scelta medici di medicina generale hanno la responsabilit di gestire le attivit comunicative con l utenza nel miglior modo possibile sempre pi solide sono le evidenze di efficacia di approcci comunicativi differenziati che possono essere utili nel colloquio prevaccinale quando genitori aderiscono alle attivit vaccinali presentandosi nei nostri ambulatori nel colloquio informativo con genitori esitanti peraltro previsto dalla stessa legge co come ogni altra situazione che generi un interazione comunicativa revisionare l organizzazione delle attivit vaccinali facilitando l adozione di un approccio comunicativo presuntivo direttivo rispetto poco efficace spesso troppo utilizzato approccio partecipativo pu determinare un miglioramento dell adesione offerta vaccinale gestire modo standardizzato la comunicazione degli eventi vaccino correlati con frequente periodicit sistemi vaccinali si ritrovano ad affrontare eventi che hanno ricadute comunicative talvolta non indifferenti sulla pratica vaccinale con la guida vaccine safety events managing communication reponse l oms ha definito le modalit di risposta ai cosiddetti eventi vaccino correlati vre come un evento avverso che segua una vaccinazione un nuovo studio risultati sperimentali notizie dai medium un rumour locale su una vaccinazione un vaccino la temporanea

certamente una sfida da affrontare nell immediato futuro formazione e diffusione della cultura vaccinale tra tutti gli operatori sanitari non accettabile che vi siano genitori italiani sottoposti opinioni discordanti da parte di operatori sanitari su un quesito vaccinale di qualsiasi natura eppure questa evenienza tanto frequente da essere un fattore di rischio noto per esitazione vaccinale italia sempre pi necessario facilitare la diffusione di una cultura vaccinale diffusa che renda ogni operatore sanitario non solo gli operatori dedicati portatore di conoscenze e informazioni
