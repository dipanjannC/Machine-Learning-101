Request For A Free Extract Download Summary Salient Trends of the Predictive Analytics Market The popularity of data mining is owing to its ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data to find redundant patterns. The data is structured to discover useful trends to harness future information. Artificial intelligence is another trend that combines historical algorithms with programming. It can be used to find trends and patterns in the data for further use. The artificial intelligence is combined with machine learning through algorithms to identify patterns within millions of data units and predict the behaviors to make future decisions without any human intervention. Deep Learning is made up of an artificial neural network with several hierarchical levels. The information learned in each level is carried over into the next level and is continued until all of the information is combined. The first levels recognize specific details that added in each level producing complete learning as a final result.
