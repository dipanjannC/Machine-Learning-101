Hence the demand for database management tools has also been rising. This has particularly translated into the rising demand for analytics for data management and strategic decision-making. At the same time the continued integration of analytics with Geographical Information System GIS and improvements in location-based services have increased the volumes of geospatial data significantly thereby necessitating the adoption of advanced analytics for optimal management of the data. Several businesses are adopting progressive analytics solutions which can potentially utilize geospatial data to locate clients on a map and draft new strategies accordingly. The growing adoption of advanced analytics in predicting and forecasting trading patterns electricity consumption patterns and traffic conditions is propelling the growth of the market. The use of analytics in demand forecasting allows organizations to make data-based informed decisions and augment profitability. Apart from incumbents of various industries and industry verticals such as manufacturing banking and professional services government agencies are also investing aggressively in big data analytics thereby driving the demand for advanced analytics. The rising demand for IoT-based predictive solutions which can potentially help in collecting and analyzing data from sensors including temperature sensors air quality sensors and motion sensors among others within the IoT network is expected to boost the adoption of advanced analytical tools over the forecast period. Type Insights The big data analytics segment accounted for the largest share of around 30% in 2020 owing to the increasing popularity of social media and the rise in the number of virtual or digital offices that produce large volumes of data. Information management is emerging as an area where big data analytics can have a significant impact on business processes and productivity. The growing adoption of big data analytics across businesses for enhancing operational efficiency and strengthening market strategies is expected to drive the growth of the segment. The customer analytics segment is expected to grow significantly over the forecast period in line with the increasing demand for improved lead management customer retention and customer experience management. The strong emphasis businesses are putting on understanding the customers buying patterns and behavior and accordingly offering a highly customizable customer experience is driving the demand for customer analytics. Continued introduction of business process automation advances in the latest technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence  www.grandviewresearch.com industry-analysis artificial-intelligence-ai-market and the integration of these technologies into customer analytics are expected to contribute to the growth of the segment. Efforts being pursued by the incumbents of the retail industry to offer an omnichannel experience to their customers and the growing adoption of customer analytics by large retailers to roll out marketing programs and personalized communications also bode well for the growth of the segment.
