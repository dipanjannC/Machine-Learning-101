Request For A Free Extract Download Summary Salient Trends of the Predictive Analytics Market The popularity of data mining is owing to its ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data to find redundant patterns. The data is structured to discover useful trends to harness future information. Artificial intelligence is another trend that combines historical algorithms with programming. It can be used to find trends and patterns in the data for further use. The artificial intelligence is combined with machine learning through algorithms to identify patterns within millions of data units and predict the behaviors to make future decisions without any human intervention. Deep Learning is made up of an artificial neural network with several hierarchical levels. The information learned in each level is carried over into the next level and is continued until all of the information is combined. The first levels recognize specific details that added in each level producing complete learning as a final result.

The cloud-based technology reduces maintenance costs as it deploys less hardware and outsourced or shared IT staff. Since cloud computing uses fewer physical resources there is less hardware to maintain. With an outsourced cloud the organization may save costs regarding storage server network and virtualization experts. Among the organization size the large enterprises accounted for a larger market share of 65% in the year 2018. The growing investments in advanced technologies such as IoT machine learning cloud computing and artificial intelligence among other such techniques is a significant driver of the segment. The small and medium-sized enterprise segment is forecasted to witness a higher growth rate of 22.7% during the forecast period. These organizations are entering into the market offering firms and customers with outsourcing services. With the emergence of cost-saving technologies such as cloud-based services and the growing penetration of the internet these organizations are expected to grow at a high pace in the coming years. The retail and e-commerceindustry accounted for the largest market share of 17% in the year 2018. The retail and e- commerce sector is rapidly investing in procurement and supply chain management systems along with data analytics. The analyzed data is used to make decisions to attain the highest possible return on investment on their products and services. The manufacturing industry is anticipated to witness the highest CAGR of 25.3% during the forecast period. With the implementation of machine learning tools such as clustering and artificial neural networks historical data can be analyzed to detect repairs machine failure operating conditions and maintenance requirements. The analysis is done using related events and predicts numerous outcomes resulting in automated recommendations on everything from breakdowns of individual machine parts to fault lines in the production process. Asia Pacific is forecasted to have the highest CAGR of 23.2% during the forecast period. The market in Asia Pacific is projected to witness a considerable growth in the market from the emerging start-ups that are focusing on the development of the internet and digital communications systems. The growing adoption of cloud-based enterprise applications has helped in reducing IT costs.
