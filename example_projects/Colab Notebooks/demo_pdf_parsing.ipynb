The company \n","<p>extracts following products: \n","<p>• Terpene \n","<p>• Phenol \n","<p>The extraction process is a continuous process at atmospheric pressure under heated conditions. Heating power is provided by a steam boiler powered by natural gas and air is provided by a compressor with a dryer. \n","\n","<s2>8 \n","\n","\n","<p>The first step of the process is the terpene extraction in two stirred extraction columns. The continuous phase is diethyl ether whereas the heavy phase is the tar and the interphase will be on the bottom of the columns. Diethyl ether is stored in a 400-liter stainless steel tank in the room and tar is at the moment supplied from IBC´s but 3 stainless steel tanks with a volume of 5.500 litres each is bought for the purpose but not yet installed. \n","<p>Ether and tar I fed by pumps to the column K1 and the heavy phase on the bottom is fed to the head of column K2 together with ether. The light phase in the top of K2 will go through evaporators and strip diethyl ether and at the end only terpene is remaining ready for collection and ether is returned to the storage tank. The next step is phenol extraction and the heavy phase from K2 can be collected in a storage tank or can directly be feed a stirred reactor. Sulferic acid is also feed the reactor to reduce the pH before introducing the solution to the head of the stirred extraction column K3. Ether is fed in the bottom of K3. The light phase on top of K3 will go through an evaporator and half the ether is returned to the ether storage tank and the other half is collected and will go through a carbon black column and after this stripped. Phenol is now collected on the bottom of an evaporator. \n","<p>The extraction plant is supplied by Pignat who also has made the ATEX-classification document and the HAZOP-analysis. \n","<p>In the near future production of other food additives are planned. This is by mixing and will take place in the neighbouring rooms (Bldg. no. 15). \n","<p>System alarms is monitored by employees outside normal business hours on a web based system. \n","<p>The extraction plant and auxiliary equipment was inspected by TÜV Nord Systems in June 2016.  \n","<p>Following data is given: \n","<p>• The consumption of diethyl ether (C\n","<s5>2\n","<p>H\n","<s5>5\n","<p>OC\n","<s5>2\n","<p>H\n","<s5>5\n","<p>) is approx. 40 litres per month \n","<p>• The production of terpene is approx. 20 litres per day \n","<p>• The production of phenols is approx. 40 litres per day \n","<p>• Liquid temperature in the system is maximum 45 °C and process steam is maximum 105 °C.

Recommendations \n","\n","<p>2019.08.15.001 formation of peroxides: Ether is probably supplied with an inhibitor to slow down formation of peroxides but when recycling the ether, the inhibitor will probably reduce in effect and formation of peroxides may occur. This may also be handled in other processes in the system, but it is recommended to review the HAZOP with Pignot to consider whether this is an issue or not. \n","<p>2019.08.15.002 depressurisation: 2019.08.15.002 depressurisation: In case of fire the ether storage tank should be able to depressurize in a controlled way. The tank was mounted with a 1,5-inch venting pipe (and valve) with a length of approx. 9 meters venting above roof level. This appears as insufficient, but the HAZOP should be reviewed to clarify this.  2019.08.15.003 level sensors: The ether tank was installed with one level sensor. The system should consist of two sensors in independent systems. One for process and one for a safety system. This is also requested by Danish legislation.  2019.08.15.004 interlocks: Interlocks between the gaseous fire suppression system, fire detection system and production equipment should be examined so production stops in case of fire and manually activation of the systems.  2019.8.15.005 electrical bonding: It is recommended to check electrical bonding at the process equipment. Not all flanges seemed bonded at the survey.  2019.08.15.006 test of HVAC: It is recommended regularly to test the ventilation system in the process area since it is a part of the hazardous area analysis. Tests should be documented in a log.   2019.08.15.007 fire compartment walls: It is recommended to inspect all fire compartment walls thoroughly, to close open penetrations, secure right materials are utilized and secure their function.  2019.08.15.008 fire compartments walls:  Fire compartment wall between Bldg. 21 and 22 is not in compliance with the principles for fire compartment walls due to wood and openings between outer cladding, roof and inner walls. Furthermore, the loadbearing steel structure is exposed in full to heat from a fire from Bldg. nos. 20 to 21. It is recommended to examine the guideline for fire detection systems hence it probably will require detection in concealed spaces which exceeds a specific volume.  Type of detection in concealed spaces required by AIG shall be considered. Type of detection shall be considered since detectors shall be accessible for inspection without removing fixed building components. Aspirational smoke detection could be considered with a filtering system and blow clean system.  In future builds it is recommended to avoid concealed spaces since they often facilitate fire, soot and smoke spreading in the building.   2019.08.15.009 fire doors and shutters: Fire doors and shutters was in general the original doors and a number of these was fitted with fusible links. Fusible links require high temperature to activate.  It is recommended to check all doors and change doors that does not have a fire rating or can be identified as fire doors. It is recommended to fit all doors in production areas with shutters and where \n","\n","<s2>25 \n","\n","\n","<p>doors need to be in an open position with an automatic shutting system activated on smoke. The system should be in accordance with DBI guideline 231 Automatic shutters.  2019.08.15.010 storage of chemicals: It is recommended to store all flammable liquids not in process on containment pallets or equal, so no free flow of chemicals can occur. It is recommended to separate storage of chemicals and production as much as possible and according the current legislation.  2019.08.15.011 solid waste: It is recommended to store solid waste in containers outside buildings with a locked lid. This should be in a distance of minimum five meters from buildings. 2019.08.15.012 training: It is recommended to set up a training programme for servicing and running the processes equipment and train regularly.  It is recommended to instruct and train employees in basic firefighting, evacuation and alarm procedures since the location is new to all. All procedures should be written and accessible at site.  2019.08.15.013 maintenance plan: It is recommended to write a maintenance plan for buildings and installations incl. inspection and test of fire safety installations.  2019.08.15.014 service contracts: It is recommended to verify that that service contracts on fire safety installations are adequate in order of response time for the contractor and level of service. The insurance company might require shut down of production if impairment periods are too long.  2019.08.15.015 CCTV: The production will run unmanned outside normal business hours but monitored by a system and the employees by a web-based system.
